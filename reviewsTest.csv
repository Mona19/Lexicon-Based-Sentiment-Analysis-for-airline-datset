 Moam Ben-Shalom,1,"Flight was half-full. I had the whole row to myself. The flight took of on time and one hour later the service started. I could choose 2 drinks. The meals service had two choices: 1) meat ball with couscous, salad and chocolate cake. 2) tuna salad, some fruits and a honey cake. After the meal service the lights inside the cabin were turned off. Every hour one of the cabin crew members came around with water. During the whole flight there was juice available in the rear galley. Two hours before landing the cabin crew gave us a second meal. Omelette, bun, butter, salad and lemon cake (that was very good). We landed on time.",7/4/2015,5,4,5,4,5,9
A Abbado,1,SQ947 and SQ378 Aug 19 2014. DPS-SIN and SIN-MXP. Nice flights attendants were perfect meal ok too many uninteresting movies.,8/26/2014,4,4,4,4,5,8
A Acosta,1,I wasn't sure about this airline when booking they far exceeded my expectations in just about every category. The one area that needs immediate improvement is the quality of the food or maybe our western taste buds are overmatched by the eastern style menu. In my opinion the food quality was horrible. But in every other category this airline is well above standard. It begins with the crew who hustles at every opportunity and provides an excellent customer service experience. The cleanliness of the aircraft was noticeable the bathrooms were kept clean and the staff were genuinely friendly. I'd rate these guys as 5 star easily 5 star. Two last notes due to the length of their flights I would recommend adding additional video content. And for some reason on our last leg (TPE-LAX) the a/c was set at an especially cold setting with most passengers resorting to their coats during flight All other legs (LAX-TPE TPE-BKK and BKK-TPE) were fine.,1/10/2014,5,5,2,4,5,10
A Acosta,0,BKK-FRA A340. Not what I expected left disappointed. No personal AVOD makes for a long 11 hour flight. Service from FA's was average took late night flight so I don't recall food quality probably slept through it. Aircraft was worn but clean ladies received orchids upon departure. Probably won't fly Thai Air in the future. I do recall seats being very thin and uncomfortable.,5/6/2013,3,2,3,1,2,4
A Adams,0,Travelled MCO-DUB with an infant. Check in all ok at the airport but once on the plane the partner of the man seated next to me in row 2 made a huge fuss about my son (who was sitting quietly and minding his own business) being in the cabin to which the female crew member replied 'I agree but there's nothing I can do about it'. The other male crew member was 'too busy' to bring an infant lap belt once the doors had closed and I was offered neither a drink or a meal. Really poor service added to an outdated seat I wouldn't recommend Aer Lingus.,4/3/2015,2,3,3,0,1,2
A Adamson,0,My flight was changed to Rouge. I didn't have enough leg room seats were horrible and when I put my tray down it was so tight it touched my stomach. I have been a supporter of Air Canada but I have had enough. Flying another airline now. Will never touch an air Canada flight again. If you want to feel what a sardine feels like in a can fly Air Canada Rouge.,5/13/2014,1,1,1,1,2,1
A Agapi,0,I chose this company as it had good fares for our trip however by the end of the trip if I sum up all the expenses it required along the way I could have bought tickets for a better airline that provides all the needed services. We had to pay 10 eur per person to do check-in at the counter. Who has heard of that? We received an email a few days before with the online check-in and it didn't state anywhere that if we don't do it online we would have to pay at the airport. Not surprisingly at the airport everyone who was on the same flight with us had the very same problem. The company is not transparent with its customers and it uses these hidden fees so they can cover up their margins. We had to pay extra for every 20 kg piece of luggage seats transaction fees and there were no meals during the flights. So adding up all these costs to the initial price of the ticket I could have easily flown with an all inclusive airline. Coming to customer service it seems that Air Baltic has no idea what that means. One crew member was extremely rude during the boarding process. She replied to my questions in a very rude way. It is sad to see that for some companies the idea of customer service is still a new concept.,7/31/2014,1,3,1,1,1,1
A Agustin,1,AC Jazz and Express from YTZ-YQB via YUL was a breeze in spite of heavy fog and two cancellations the ground staff at Billy Bishop Airport was very helpful and respectful to passengers. AC Jazz from YQB to YYZ was smooth and the flight attendants were great. It was a smooth and pleasant flight back to Toronto.,9/16/2013,4,4,3,0,4,8
A Ahmed,0,"LHR-NCL-LHR. I was rather disappointed to learn that my early morning Sunday flight was cancelled without any reason on the afternoon before the morning I was to fly - the whole point of this trip was so I could easily go back and return the same day to attend my sisters wedding, saving time and also money due to the trains being so expensive. I managed to rearrange my flight for the previous night and while annoyed I had to now arrange last minute accommodation, I thought this would be straightforward and as far as re-booking it was via the BA app. What it didn't tell me was that the flight I re-arranged to fly out with was severely delayed and my heart sank as I received a a text/app notification telling me so - I think this was very sneaky not to mention before re-booking and I spent a couple of hours getting to know Terminal 5. The general feedback from here and from friends is flights on this particular domestic route are often subject to delays and cancellation, and for a full service airline that is simply unacceptable - more than anything when everything else is cutback, reliability becomes golden. The plane itself was immaculately maintained and clean and I liked the simple but elegant cabin. BA staff also do let things down a bit, often quite brusque and unfriendly, and the desk staff do come across rather insincere when there are issues as there was here. Cabin Crew were fine, but lack warmth of some other Airlines. Sadly there aren't any other options on this route, so will probably be switching back to rail, despite sometimes competitive fares.",6/18/2015,3,3,3,NaN,3,3
A Ahmed,0,"STN-NCL. The booking process is confusing and unclear there is a constant feeling you're trying to be tricked into paying for things you don't want. Online check in did not work and seems to be a common recurring problem going by other reviews here I fly with only hand baggage for these short hops so I can arrive later at the airport and walk through without having to queue at a desk - this defeats the point of this if I have to check-in the old-fashioned way. Of course I didn't get a window seat because they had been taken and I didn't want to pay the obscene charge to pre-select. They chose Stansted for this route - this airport is decrepit and dark security is overcrowded and a mess with poor management of queues. Moving on to boarding - the misinformation flyBe give which adds to passengers frustration - we were told we had to be at the gate 45 minutes before the flight this is excessive and pointless. Arriving at the gate the board said it was open - it wasn't with no one about. Then it said they were boarding again it wasn't. Then finally 15 minutes before the depart time said gate was closed - we haven't even boarded. We didn't board until the scheduled depart time. Boarding was on foot in the rain with no bus or sheltered path. Upon boarding it was clear the Dash 8 Q400 aircraft had seen better days cabin looked very tatty and tired and a lot of passengers didn't seem to be aware of the size limitations for cabin baggage boarding took significantly longer than it should have. The seat itself was thin hard and unsupportive and looked very tatty with scratches and frayed bits hanging off. Departed 15 minutes late with no explanation or reason given for the delay. Cabin Service Manager was friendly but her colleague was surly and stroppy. FlyBe like to pretend they are above the low-cost carriers such as easyJet but they are anything but and this is very poor replacement for the easyJet's flight from/to Gatwick that were ended at the end of March - not only with the odd flight times and use of Stansted but also because of the poor quality of their short-haul product. It's ironic with their current tag line of ""Faster than road or rail"" they are trying to compete with these forms of transport but with the delays it is anything but and the overall experience is so joyless - it is doing the opposite and I will probably save the hassle and get the train next time.",4/8/2015,3,1,2,0,2,4
A Ahmed,1,"LGW-KEF-PDX, PDX-KEF, KEF-LHR. I flew to Portland to visit friends with a 4 day stopover on the way back in Iceland which is included at no extra cost. I think I agree with the review by M Brown on the 20th March, people are being are rather unfair particularly with regards to the catering situation on Icelandair - they are very clear on what the product being offered here is and there is opportunity once booked to add food from the regular menu at a discount before flying and this is served to you before the main food service begins. I only pre-ordered food outbound on the long-haul KEF-PDX sector and found what was served to be delicious and good value. All non-alcoholic drinks are complimentary and can be requested at any time during the flight. All sectors were on B757, which whilst relatively old were immaculately maintained. Outbound from Gatwick the plane was a bit older and had no IFE, but this was ok for the short flight to ReykjavÃ­k and I was notified 24hrs prior to departure of this via text. On the long-haul sector from KeflavÃ­k to Portland the aircraft was more the Icelandair standard product and we were presented with bottle of Icelandic water which was a nice touch. There was IFE on this sector but it was very old, with poor quality picture and didn't have a fantastic selection - but I had brought my own entertainment with me anyway. The staff however on this flight were fantastic and really worked hard to be friendly and attentive to passengers needs so much so I will be writing to Icelandair to tell them so! Flying back to ReykjavÃ­k was pleasant with blankets and cushions provided for this overnight sector and IFE was newer and the the best of all the sectors with a clear picture. My return to London a few days later was also fine with everything on schedule and generally pleasant. One thing that didn't work on any sector was mobile boarding passes - this didn't work on a single sector for me, but I easily received a paper version in most cases. Apart from little niggles which made the experience less than perfect overall I was satisfied with my experience, it was fantastic value for money with the added plus of the stopover and would be very happy to use them again.",6/21/2015,5,3,4,1,4,8
A Ahmed,1,EDI-ARN-EDI. They text you flight details on opening of check-in (2 hours before the flight) along with gate number which is useful information. Manual check-in only at Edinburgh as they do not offer online check-in however no queues. Older B737-300 and did not have wifi available. They did have the new slimline leather seats and seat pitch was more than adequate but for those taller than 5'6 it maybe more of an issue. Staff on board were friendly and onboard food available to buy was reasonably priced and looked of good quality. Landed in Stockholm early. Return flight similar to outgoing. Norwegian take part in Arlanda's common check-in kiosk system which allows you to check-in at Stockholm Central Railway Station before catching the Arlanda Express. Baggage allowance is generous and flexible. Landing at Arlanda is a big bonus as is allocation of seats before boarding and the overall service is worth the little bit extra over the competing service offered by Ryanair to Skavsta (which isn't even in Stockholm) - also without the general unpleasantness with that operator. Overall very satisfied with the service.,2/28/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
A Akerlund,0,Flew GVA-IST-AUH. Seats were dirty and could hardly be reclined footrest is a joke. On both legs staff rushed through the meal to the point where my husband had to physically hold on to his tray (IST-AUH). Staff not very friendly no greeting during boarding and an unapproachable attitude during the flights seats in front of us were used by cabin crew to sleep during the flight between IST-AUH. Entertainment system was poor compared to what other airlines have to offer. On both flights the toilet was smelly and did not feel clean. Not looking forward to our return flights nor the changing of planes in Istanbul we will avoid them in the future.,1/13/2014,2,1,3,2,1,3
A Ala-JÃ¤Ã¤ski,1,"This was my first time on Turkish Airlines (Helsinki-Istanbul-Helsinki). The plane was ok I liked the leather seats and there was enough space for me. The seats seemed a bit ""worn out "" to me though. The plane could have been tidier I guess it had just brought passengers to Helsinki and there was only a little time to clean it. The toilets were much cleaner than on other airliners' planes which was nice. Food was really good and it felt luxurious to be able choose from two menus! They showed quite new movies during the flight but when we flew back to Helsinki there was no sound coming from the audio system. This problem affected all the passengers not just me. The flight attendant couldn't do anything about this problem. What really upset me was the cabin crew's attitude on safety matters. Flight attendants didn't care at all about the position of passengers' seats tray tables or hand luggage during take off and landing. It definitely didn't give a good impression of safety issues. I have also got used to cabin crew paying attention to seat belt sign during turbulent weather but they just let people move around and use toilets normally.",12/4/2013,4,3,5,3,2,7
A Alexandersson,1,LGW-KIV on Embraer 190. Departed on time and arrived a little early. FA's were polite and efficient. Catering was a sandwich and a choice of Hot drinks Soft drinks and Moldovan Wine. No IFE but not a problem on a 3hr flight. Only strange aspects were the very stocked duty free trolley coming through the plane but with absolutely no price lists or catalogues so I had no idea what they were selling and that the cockpit messages to staff were in Romanian which surprised me as most airlines now do them in English. Just one quick note be prepared to be locked in the airport for a while. My luggage actually came through first but when I cleared customs and headed for the exit I could see my friends waiting for me but the doors taking me landside were locked after much rattling around 10 mins later a staff member came and pressed the button to let us out! I would gladly fly with them again and the direct flight makes this the best option on this route.,4/3/2013,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Ali,0,I traveled from YYZ-KHI with PIA last year. My first and last time with PIA. I would rather pay a few extra bucks and fly Emirates or Turkish Airlines. During my flight my seat was broken and I asked the male flight attendant to change my seat. He just gave me a dry response by saying that the flight was full. I was shocked to hear this type of customer service. The least he could have done was to offer to fix the seat. I was sitting on the broken seat for 14 hours. I didn't go to the washroom because 2 of them were leaking and the other was out of order. The IFE system did not work at all and when I asked the flight attendant to fix it he said ok and just disappeared. Overall a very bad experience with PIA and there are a lot more options.,11/11/2014,1,1,1,1,1,NaN
A Ali,0,First time travelling RJ from London to Amman to Madinah and Jeddah to Amman to London return. Reserved seats for all four flights for me my wife and 8 year old daughter. Not one of the flights had us seated together. Had to request other kind passengers to move. Food is fish meat or veg with same sauce. Seats were average with leg room better on the short haul flights than the long haul which was irritating. A lot of the passengers were unhappy with the allocation of seats. Looks like RJ cant deal with full capacity.,6/9/2013,3,2,3,3,3,4
A Allen,0,"Terrible experience with Etihad. Booked 5 business class seats Sydney-Abu Dhabi-Cairo return for family with 3 children. Thought it would make the trip easier as younger 2 kids only 5 and 2. Also Business promised overnight hotel accommodation in Abu Dhabi so we justified the huge expense and thought we'd travel in style! Every leg we were seated separately including putting the 2 year old next to strangers. Just assumed I guess we would have seating together. After first leg refused to change seating for other legs. Refused - told we had to wait until on the aircraft and for attendants to approach other passengers to change. Watched anxiously on every leg as they seated and settled every other passenger before they would try to get my kids near us. Arrived late at night after long flight into Abu Dhabi from Sydney expecting hotel room. Airport almost deserted eventually found long line of weary travellers waiting for single attendant. Waited in line for 2 hours with children and adults close to hysterical by then. Eventually reach end of line and are told no booking made for room for us - then later found. Kids in separate hotel room on another floor! Unable even to have adjacent rooms. Service in plane polite but hardly existent. Bell would expire before attended. Twice sent feedback to Etihad. First not even answered second approach through social media got quick request for details which I provided. Response then was not an apology but ""disappointment' at my negative 'impression' of their superior service and well trained staff. They assured me that just because I didn't get my 'preferred seating' (as if I'd just wanted a window seat rather than to be near my children) they win awards for their 'inspired' experience. Would never fly Etihad again!",10/22/2014,1,2,2,3,1,1
A Altenbernd,0,Business class from LHR to GIG on September 28th 2013. It was a very bad flight mainly because of the worst crew I have seen. This crew were arrogant incompetent with inadequate behavior. As soon as we got the plane there was no welcome. They did not give us blankets and pillows we had to ask for it. When they start serving the dinner they brought everything on the same tray. Starters soup and main dish and of course when we started the main dish it was already cold. No dessert coffee tea offered. Just after they served dinner a small bit of turbulence began the seat belt sign was turned on. Turbulence last for about 5 minutes time for the crew stop the service and started their own dinner leaving everything on the tables. I have been complaining about this flight because it was an absurd. The crew are paid for doing their job. I will never choose TAM again mainly because of the way they handle the service I got.,4/13/2014,1,4,2,2,1,NaN
A Althani,0,Most of my travel is for holidays and two of my last two trips were on Etihad. The first was to South Africa on Etihad and South African the latest was on Etihad and Alitalia - both disastrous. We travelled from Doha through Abu Dhabi to Rome and onto Venice waiting for our Cruise in the Mediterranean now Alitalia ground staff have been on strike. Etihad knew of this strike but still checked my bags through to Venice knowing my bags could have not made it through. It has been three days without our bags and they can't even locate them and I will have to go on a 12 day cruise without luggage other than that I will have to fly with them to go back home.,8/11/2014,1,1,4,3,4,1
A Althani,1,This was my return flight from Paris CDG to DOH via FRA in Business Class the flight from CDG to FRA was on an Airbus A321 was comfortable with prompt efficient service all on time though I was troubled that at check in although I explained to the staff that I had fragile glass ornaments but they refused to put a handle with care stickers on my bags. The portion from Frankfurt to Doha was on an Airbus A330 with the new business class which was very nice and excellent service with wonderful meal selection I really liked the Bavarian Goose. Though the connection time was very short just one hour but all our bags made it through which was also very nice.,1/14/2015,5,4,5,3,5,9
A Althani,1,DOH-JED-DOH. Qatar Airways offers a Business Class layout as First Class on this route we flew out on a 777 and returned on their new 787-8 a first time for me on the Dreamliner personally I would call my review a mixed review. No one can fault Qatar Airways class of service they are top notch from the moment you enter into the airport to the moment you pick up your luggage and head home my only draw back is surprise surprise the Dreamliner. The way the layout is you always get distracted by the TV screens of other passengers you cannot concentrate on your reading nor can you watch something peacefully. There is plenty of storage room on the seat but the operating system of the entertainment is a little complicated. I hope that Qatar Airways review the layout of their new A350.,8/3/2014,4,4,5,3,5,8
A Althani,1,DXB-JNB and on to DUR. The Dubai-Johannesburg was on an Emirates code share flight so I will not review it here but the JNB-DUR was on a proper SAA flight and they have always delivered a high quality product they are attentive and extremely helpful even with the meal. We are Muslims but forgot to ask for a Muslim meal but their flight attendant brought us a vegetarian choice from Economy Class.,7/12/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Al-Thani,0,DOH-BAH-CDG return in business class. We got the flat bed seats because we paid the J class fare IFE was old and terrible the food was not good on outbound but much better on the return flight. Seat was okay at best though the width was nice.,1/17/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,5
A Amaladoss,1,YYZ-LHR was rebooked by BA on to this flight as their flight was cancelled due to a bird strike. Check-in very straightforward. Used the Maple Leaf lounge in Terminal 1 close to the E gates. Spacious comfortable lounge but no hot options for breakfast apart from a very sticky oatmeal porridge. Flight was on a B767 with a herring bone 1-1-1 configuration. It felt both spacious and private. The crew were engaging and very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The breakfast omelette was rather nice. IFE of a good quality but using the headphones was fiddly because you had to put on the sponge ear covers yourself! Seats are lie flat and quite comfortable-managed a nap of a couple of hours. The serving of lunch was delayed by some turbulence over the Atlantic. The Captain was very reassuring especially as he asked the FAs to be seated as well for about 30 mins. Good choice of champagne and 2 whites and 3 reds. There was a choice of 3 mains-all looked tasty. Arrival was shambolic because of the immigration computer glitch-baggage was waiting when I got to the carousel. Generally very impressed with my first experience of AC Executive Class.,5/7/2014,5,5,5,3,5,9
A Amaladoss,1,LHR-YYZ in business was looking forward to a B787 but this flight was a B777. Had the rear facing seat- comfortable enough but it is always awkward trying to clamber over the passenger seated diagonally opposite. Enjoyed the plentiful supply of pink champagne. Lunch was fine as was the afternoon tea. IFE screen on the small side but managed one movie. Crew were pleasant friendly and efficient.,5/7/2014,4,4,4,3,5,8
A Anagnostellis,1,Flew Business class from SYD to JFK via HKG on Qantas points - a long trip but easy HKG connection and comfortable seating on both sectors particularly with the new 1-2-1 configuration. Service was pleasant and efficient and good food quality although limited IFE options detracted from overall experience. Very pleased to avoid LAX even if a few hours longer and evening HKG departure made for a restful evening sleep. Great way to get to North America from Australia.,11/6/2014,4,4,3,2,4,7
A Anderson,0,We were standby customers for flights on MaxJet from Dulles to Stansted and Stansted to Dulles flights. We had no problems getting seats on the plane at the time of checkin. Was a little worried since they only have one flight a day but not problems. We had no issues with flights being cancelled. I will say that we left a little later than the scheduled time but we boarded on time so the delay could have been airport traffic. It was great to be served finger foods and champagne before takeoff. You get a salad with bread and your choice of an entree. It will depend which entree you get on how good it is. If you are flying to UK get the fish from UK get the chicken curry or salmon. Deserts are delicious. They also have a deal with the Radisson hotel in stansted so you can shower and eat breakfast buffet (if you have time of course before your connection flight). Everyone was friendly and helpful on the flight. The entertainment unit is good even though there can be issues with batteries running out. Plenty of movies music videos shows to watch.,9/1/2007,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,5
A Anderson,0,"I paid an additional $100 on departure and $40 on the return. I read the rules and attempted to interface with the website! I cannot find one positive review. Unfortunately my wife and I elected to participate in a ""Mystery Deal"" and drew Spirit. Had we known it was Spirit in advance we would have passed. Spirit really is the Greyhound Bus of the sky.

A Andersson,0,"JFK-ARN-OSL. The ""new fresh vibrant Norwegian long distance flights that will revolutionise air travel"" is in fact the worse travel experience I have ever had.

A Angus,0,To and from LAX to Lima plus internal flights to Cusco and Puno/Juiliaco. Most flights not on time and only explanation was that there was congestion and problems with communications. Originally flight from LAX ran about 30 minutes late so unable to make next internal connection to Cusco. Told that flight already left even thought it was not scheduled for another 30 minutes+. Told to come back to the counter in 50 minutes then may be given a standby ticket to wait in another line with all our luggage. Offered vouchers for lunch - turned out the only option was at McDonalds and then only for two meal choices.,1/9/2013,1,4,2,4,2,3
A Ankelstam,1,ARN-LGW-ARN Oct 04-06 on a almost new B737-800. Very smooth boarding and flight took off and landed according to time schedule. Being a low-fare airline getting there on time and in a safe way is priority no 1! Flying within Europe with Norwegian is a dream however I would think twice before going long-haul due to technical problems with B787. Remember that low-fare airlines charge extra for (almost) everything - it's part of the concept!,10/12/2014,5,4,0,0,4,9

A Ariane,1,Used them on DUB-SOU return. Both flights on time comfortable plane for the journey fairly new DH8 with clean interior. Staff a bit impersonal but perfectly capable and no in-your-face advertisement and hassling like rival LCCs.

A Armie,0,Turkey-Jeddah-Manila. First leg was chaotic. No system at all. Passengers were not informed by staff when to enter the aircraft. Flight delayed an hour. Arrived at Jeddah late. Cabin was so dirty especially the toilet! No entertainment at all during flights. Staff informed us the next flight would be the following day. We were brought to the passengers lounge. Stayed at the airport for 27 hours with no couch to sleep on. Really very poor service. That would be our first and last experience with this airline.,5/5/2013,2,3,3,1,3,1

The flight was on time, the staff were friendly and very attentive, the aircraft was a new, comfortable, quiet ATR-42-600. We were offered drinks on the sector from St. Lucia to Trinidad. What was
nice was that we stayed on board the plane in St. Lucia, rather than having to get off and reboard. My baggage came with me on time and I was more than happy with the service with LIAT. Also the price was great! $175EC one way!",6/12/2015,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,10
A Arora,1,Gatwick-Malaga. It was a nice clean aircraft equipped with strong wifi. First time in life we were taking calls on board. The check in process was not organized at Malaga which they need to improve. The online check is not available at Malaga which resulted in long queues.,5/25/2014,5,3,0,3,4,8
A Arriens,1,PUS-GMP 737-500. The weather was deteriorating and we were caught off guard by a typhoon heading our way. We got rebooked for free quick and friendly service. At the gate the flights would all be cancelled. The flight was bulk loaded pilots ready. The first delay occurred as extra service agents were called to the gate and were providing information to the passengers. After an hour delay we observed extra pilots boarding as well we learned the captain after deliberating safety being his major concern decided to fly out. A quick boarding nearly full flight and we took off in heavy winds and weather while dark. Despite the weather the pilot remarked thanking us for coming along for the ride saying Hang tight and nice flight which broke the tension. Even though it was a bumpy flight the crew were really calm and nice which calmed us all they spoke English too. It's times like this they must remain calm and they did. Not one time did we feel anything other than our safety was what was most important. A very capable and friendly airline.,11/28/2013,4,3,3,5,4,9
A Arriens,1,Didn't fly them for a while because I found them expensive. Flew JFK-AMS B747 combi. At the gate they didn't articulate while calling for boarding. Received just breakfast o/b. Very old plane needs to be refurbished badly seats IFE screen. In-flight product is very well done reasonably good food and good presentation. Wouldn't want to fly the old workhorse again but KLM did provide a nice flight.,11/21/2013,4,3,3,3,4,7
A Arriens,1,AMS-IST-AMS Business Class. Their Lounge at AMS has been reduced by 50% which can get uncomfortable during the busy hours. Food and beverages are scarce. But it's a clean friendly environment! A340-300 to IST just a few business class passengers. The seats are worn but not worn-out. I preferred a low calorie meal which turned out to be fish. The meal itself was good enough. We landed on time. My flight outbound from IST is always late no matter the weather. Late boarding late departure. My plane was already there! Service on-board was good. Business load [sold seats] was high. The best part of the trip is the CIP lounge!,6/4/2014,5,4,3,4,4,6
A Arriens,0,IST-AMS A332. Friend and I were in the CIP lounge where the staff remind you to keep track of your own flight status. We had plenty of time arrived at the lounge 2.5hrs prior to departure. At 1.5hr prior to departure I went for a smoke and the flight status was not open. After 10mins when I returned the status was last call. This was a bus gate boarding and was really unsatisfactory. Beware of this. I would fly TK again but this was a terrible experience.,11/29/2013,3,5,1,3,3,1
A Artman,1,Very good service they served two meals - dinner and breakfast and both times offered two choices (none of the USA airlines would feed you twice for free). They also offered free wine. All amenities were free of charge they offered newspapers free of charge (Russian newspapers though). The entertainment was poor. Cannot complaint about the 767 comfort.,5/4/2013,4,4,5,2,5,9
A Arvin,0,ORD-KUL via HKG. I found service on both legs of my flight to be not good at all. The crew were not attentive and spent most of the time in the galley. They hardly served drinks throughout the flight. Food was average at best and the Western options were not good.,8/28/2014,4,3,2,3,1,5
A Arvin,1,KUL-CDG. A380 was good and flight was filled to the brim. I'm not a big fan of the hard seats but it wasn't hard to get a good night sleep. One of the 2 stewardess weren't very attentive and could have done better while the other one was fantastic. Food is great as usual and they offered drinks on several rounds. Check In is done via a kiosk now so things are faster.,8/28/2014,5,4,5,5,4,10
A Arzooni,1,"Such relief to get on an EL AL flight after other planes. Swiss and El Al are up there then Lufthansa then the rest. You feel like you're finally taken care of. Good well maintained planes responsible professional flight attendants normal seats (better on Swiss but the El Al entertainment was much better). Very good food the attendant offered a second ""leftover"" plateau when my colleague said he was still hungry. They get the job done professionally and with care. All in all great experience.",5/31/2015,0,0,0,0,0,9
A Asprakis,1,RHO-ATH-FCO. This should be listed as a 4-star airline. Clean new planes excellent meals featuring Greek items and the most courteous FA's I have encountered in years. A pleasure to fly!,8/11/2013,5,5,5,3,5,10
A Aston,0,Flight out delayed an hour. We were flying to Cancun we had about 2.5 hours to go when they said there was only 1 toilet working people were queuing 45 mins to use it. The inflight service stopped which is very annoying when you have upgraded. The seats were very uncomfortable there was a crying child in front and when the seat in front was reclined they were almost in your lap. Food was mediocre.,3/30/2013,2,2,3,2,3,2
A Attaran,0,Saigon-Haiphong and Hanoi-Danang. In what I hope is a meaningful comparison Jetstar Pacific is in the middle of the pack by international standards: check-in staff friendliness baggage handling food and tidiness were far beneath the standard of Singapore Airways or Thai but vastly better than United Northwest Delta or the other major American carriers. Both flights were about 30 minutes late but these days when a delay is an honest 30 minutes and does not ratchet upwards because of the airline's inability to communicate accurately I actually feel relieved. Legroom is very tight by Western standards but that is understandable since the Vietnamese are elegantly small in stature. Considering that a typical flight on Jetstar Pacific will set you back only $50 or so overall this is pretty good - three and a half stars.,12/31/2008,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,3
A Austin,0,Dublin to Charlotte (5th July 13) Charlotte to Dublin (12th July 13). Disappointment at both flights but especially Dublin to Charlotte: 1) ran out of earphones so no entertainment for 8 hours. 2) one of the toilets out of order for full flight. 3) another toilet ran out of toilet paper. 4) hot breakfast ice cold. Return flight - my wife asked if we could upgrade but were told flight full. Expected to depart at 6.20pm but did not board until approx 7pm despite on-time advised. Made to sit on plane while we waited for passengers from another flight who had missed their flight to Paris - eventual departure 8pm. Some of these were put in first class although we had been told flight full with no upgrades!,7/17/2013,1,3,1,0,1,NaN
A Avery,0,"They were incredibly inconsiderate. The first leg of my flight was delayed by weather at the destination airport yet the second leg departed from that airport ahead of schedule. Half of my flight was told that the next available flight was 24 hours later or that we could go to an alternative airport 1.5 hours from the original destination in 12 hours. No meal voucher no hotel no compensation - we all slept on the floor. The desk attendant's consolation was ""Well it's better you don't have a hotel because you would have had to come back very early in the morning regardless."" Also add the usual complaints about charging more for carry-on luggage but not warning of the charge when purchasing the ticket. The seats were the most uncomfortable I've sat in. I'm 5'10 and 140 pounds and never have a problem yet I was sore after a 2 hour leg. I'd hate to imagine what the larger passengers had to endure.",3/9/2015,1,1,1,1,1,1
A Aweidah,1,TLV-MAD-SVQ and back. The price was the big plus and I have to say that I made all my connections even with a short transfer at Madrid Barajas. All flights were on time with small and very old A319 on the 5.5 hours TLV-MAD. Flight was full cramped and very uncomfortable. Plane food atrocious on both legs. MAD-SVQ-MAD was with Iberia Express with much better and more enthusiastic crew and no service as on low cost airlines and frankly I prefer that since you do not get bothered with the whole meal and service show. Overall I would fly them again since price and punctuality are much more important than atrocious service and terrible food. They should stick to no frills low cost model since that's what they are good for they have no hope in hell of doing any better.,5/12/2013,5,1,1,1,3,8
A Aweidah,1,Flew Mexico to TLV via Amsterdam old 747 but cabin in good condition and clean had the emergency exit seat so lots of legroom even though the seats are so narrow. The new in flight system is excellent with plenty of choice. Cabin crew and food good and the usual KLM style. Its a good solid airline that can be relied upon. Schipol is also a very convenient airport to transit through. Will fly them again for sure.,11/8/2013,4,3,4,5,4,8
A Aweidah,1,TLV-DXB-TLV via Amman and again the same good experience with RJ. All 4 flights exactly on time no issue with service on board although the movie selection is fairly limited. Food was good and legroom on A321 more than adequate. Amman airport is a breeze to transit through and RJ crown lounge comfortable although food selection is very very basic and internet can be unpredictable. The rate was so cheap in comparison with any other choice. RJ are a good dependable airline and my first choice for travel inside the Middle East. They beat Emirates and Etihad hands down on flights to the UAE. Highly recommend.,6/25/2014,5,5,5,3,4,8
A Aweidah,0,TLV-ZRH-MAD and back flights between TLV-ZRH on A330 and A340. Cramped seating terrible crew poor food and the A340 is well past retirement age. Cabin worn out and inflight entertainment very old with analog like screens. ZRH-MAD-ZRH on newer A320 slightly more comfortable and nicer leather seats. ZRH airport is nice and transfer was easy and straightforward. Would not fly them again. Should consider sticking to short haul inter-European flights as long haul aircraft's are too old.,6/11/2013,2,1,1,1,1,NaN
A Aznar,1,ALC-MAD-LHR in Business class and first leg operated by Iberia Express. All flights on time small business class cabin attentive service I was served a small tasty snack together with a glass of cava on the first leg of the journey. On the MAD-LHR great purser very attentive constant rounds of water great food choices of entrees great wines and spirits. Bang on time. Must be my luck but I find Iberia faultless. The Dali Lounge in Madrid is comfortable with great food offerings less crowded than the BA Galleries in T5.,8/23/2012,5,4,5,0,5,9
A B Mannes,0,"I'm a former law enforcement officer with a knee injury. Unfortunately as I live in Philadelphia I fly US Airways as they have a near monopoly on long non-stops out of PHL. I fly every month and am always accommodated through the ADA into the bulkhead seat for the extra legroom as I'm 6'3"". On the rare occasions that my afraid- of-flying wife is accompanying me she has (since 2009) been accommodated with me in the next seat as a courtesy. Last week I booked two trips one for a conference and one vacation that my wife is accompanying me on. On my customary call to US Airways to get my ADA accommodation (because there's no way to do this online when you book the seats) I was told that my wife would have to sit separate from me or I'd have to pay for the ""choice seat"". When I explained to the customer service agents they all stated that there is nothing they can do for me as all they had to do under the law was accommodate me and my wife had to pay the fee. I fly at least 12-20 times a year with US Airways and they'd rather offend me by making my wife pay a fee to sit in the disabled row next to me for a lousy $52 each way? The mere principal here is rude. The shame is that I'm stuck with stops if I switch carriers but am considering doing so immediately. Southwest is looking better to me every day and the minute JetBlue comes to PHL I'm taking all my business there.",1/14/2015,2,1,1,1,1,NaN
A Bagul,0,JFK to Mumbai via Abu Dhabi. The staff in Abu Dhabi were very rude they have zero understanding of the boarding process. Flight was delayed by 1 hr and they kept saying the flight was on time. Food was ok. Return journey similar issue. Flight from Mumbai to Abu Dhabi was delayed 2 hrs. Abu Dhabi to JFK flight was good. I would not travel Etihad again.,3/28/2014,2,2,2,2,3,1
A Bailey,0,"Pensacola to San Francisco. After paying full fare for a toddler in a seat my pregnant daughter was treated so inconsiderately by American Airlines staff. No pre-board because ""there are too many children on this flight"" and they took her stroller away so that she had to carry 2 bags and the child. On one leg of the flight they gave her back the stroller last and nearly made her miss her connection.",7/13/2014,1,1,1,1,1,1
A Aamir,1,We have travelled to Pakistan many times on PIA from Toronto to Karachi and I have to say that the experience was great.

A Baker,0,Out on 18th January return 2nd March. Both flights on the 747 as our son is a full time wheelchair user and can get to seat on lower deck without transferring to an aisle chair. Terminal 2 a nightmare as no assistance was offered and signage is poor. 747s being phased out not before time as both flights the seats were stained and cabin in need of a good clean. Out to Bangkok again in July and looking forward and hope this flight on the new A380 if we can access the upper deck in business class with our son and cabin crew have improved. Food on a par with most airline food - uninspiring! Inflight entertainment kept dropping out and had to be reset 3 times. We fly with Thai 2/3 times a year to Bangkok and sorry to say the service seems to have got worse on international flights.,3/25/2015,2,2,2,2,2,2
A Barbulescu,1,Bucharest-Istanbul return. Very good price for that sector considering almost no competition (only Turkish). For a 50 min flight they provided snack and wine/beer/juices which is very rare nowadays. Flights arrived on time. Cabin could use a little refurb.,9/1/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9

I was at the check in of Virgin Blue and I have been answered ""Sorry Etihad decided to move you on the next flight"" and we cannot do anything about it.

A Acosta,1,LAX-NRT 777-300ER. FA's stop to pick up every little thing dropped and do everything to keep aircraft spotless. Service was always with a smile. This is my new preferred airline of choice. NRT-BKK 767-300 same excellent service but aircraft was worn and seats seemed to be closer together. Based on service of FA I won't hesitate to choose ANA in the future.,5/5/2013,5,5,5,4,5,10

When the flight from Alotau to Port Moresby was cancelled we were in a challenging situation, then when the rebooked flight from Alotau to Moresby couldn't land because of difficult weather conditions we had to overnight in Alotau and hope to connect early through a rescheduled flight from Alotau the following morning.

A Acosta,0,"4/10/2015 FRA-LAX LH 456. Lufthansa from FRA to LAX on A380 economy class and won't repeat this mistake anytime in the future. Seat pitch is listed as 31"" but felt more like 28"". Width is listed as 17"" and that felt about right. Seat configuration is 3-4-3 which is pretty much standard. It was just too cramped again I believe the pitch that Lufthansa list is wrong as I've never felt so tight with a 31"" pitch and I've recently lost 25 pounds. All else was great. Food was above industry standard staff were polite and attentive after meal drinks were plentiful and included brandy wine and beer at no charge. Snacks were passed out during duration of flight. Flight entertainment was weak but having a place to charge my laptop was handy as well as WiFi although slow and charged at 17euro. Unfortunately I have a bad back and will have to take a different carrier next time out.",4/16/2015,2,1,5,3,5,3
A Barlow,1,LH 435 ORD-MUC 2/6/2014-2/7/2014. Good flight. I was lucky that the seat next to me was empty so I had more space. Otherwise the seat would have been really small. Service staff friendliness punctuality were all better than on previous flights with other airlines.,2/11/2014,4,3,4,5,4,9
A Adams,0,"Arrived early to check in, get good seats and relax in the lounge. Told the flight was overbooked and to wait. After an hour we asked what was going on and told sorry sir, we'll get a supervisor. Offered 300 USD to fly 12 hours later (no thanks) we paid 8000AUD for these flights. Staff were nonchalant and pretty uncaring. We finally got seats, but not together. Never again - best airline, yeah right!",7/23/2015,1,2,2,3,2,2
A Barnes,1,LHR-SIN-DPS. Flew on the A380 and booked the preferred seating for extra legroom. While this was a blessing the reduction in seat width wasn't ideal. The seats were a little too firm for my liking. Other than that the experience was fantastic. Entertainment choice was plentiful the food was good and the cabin crew were excellent.

A Adams,0,On November 5 2014 I flew US Airways - what a mistake. I am disabled and my husband checked the night before to make sure a wheelchair would be ready at the airport. Seattle to Tucson via Phoenix. No wheelchair in Seattle finally after waiting at check-in for 45 minutes the desk clerk was worried I was going to miss the flight and grabbed a wheel chair and I was put on plane at the last minute. Arrived at Phoenix - no wheelchair - person working at desk ignored me. Another passenger interrupted her and told her I needed assistance and I finally got help. Arrived in Tucson - no wheelchair - had to walk from tarmac to baggage. Wheelchair available for another customer - asked the person if he could get one for me he shrugged his shoulders and walked off. Customer service a nightmare - do not want to talk to you in person. The prices are good but they do not care about there customers.,11/12/2014,3,3,2,1,1,1
A Barnes,0,Four members of our family used Virgin America for our return flight from San Francisco to Chicago. Included in our party was our 81 year old mother who uses a walker. She always gets a window seat for the least possibility of the need to move. The flight became unbearable when 5 passengers from the back came to visit with the 3 passengers seating directly in the row in front of us. As they ordered several rounds of alcohol they begin cursing. What made matters worse is that when we complained to the steward they suggest that we move to the back of the plane and that there was nothing they could do. Due to our mother's condition we were unable to move but they continued to bring the rounds of alcohol to the party in front of us. We felt like we were in a bar our fight was from 7.45pm to midnight central time and our mother had to endure 3 hours of torture. We will never use this airline again.,8/7/2012,3,4,3,4,1,2
A Adrian,1,Odessa to Kiev return. Plane a rather old Boeing 737 but for such short trips (under 1 hour) is not a problem. I was surprised to see that they offered sandwiches on both flights together with tea coffee and juices.,10/13/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,7
A Agassi,0,I flew this airline from JFK to Moscow and the flight was terrible. We got the same food for breakfast lunch and dinner and it was meat with rice that was 2 out of the 3 times cold.

A Baronov,0,New Orleans to Denver: heavy rain flight delayed. Staff tell us we won't make our connection so should go back pay for our own hotel and try again tomorrow. We insist that we go to Denver now they reluctantly concede but take us off the connection flight giving us tickets for next day. We should have insisted that we get the boarding passes for the connection and then change those if we can't make it. Before departing we call our travel agency who tell us that there is a United flight with seats departing the same day and Frontier was responsible for placing us on that. Onboard: staff start asking me where I'm going then essentially grab my carry-on bag out of my hand to check it in. I explain that due to my short connection my bag will almost certainly not make it and ask to check for a space. They say no. I was shocked by their abruptness and rudeness. In Denver: our connection is delayed and is boarding as we leave the plane. They won't let us on. After a phone call staff at the gate decide to let us on. In Seattle: naturally they didn't get my bag there on time. I had to get it myself the next day.,5/13/2013,1,3,2,1,1,NaN
A Ahmed,0,BKK-CMB-MLE. Handling agents at BKK were very poorly informed on running the system numerous problems arose and it took over an hour to check in. During check-in they informed us that the CMB-MLE leg of our trip had been cancelled and that we that it was rescheduled for next morning. At CMB we asked the information counter about the transit hotel assigned to us at BKK. They claimed to have never heard of it and were no help at all whatsoever. All this happened in the middle of the night so we were really frustrated. The woman at the transit counter was exceptionally rude. We were then put on a bus with some other passengers and were brought to a small and very dirty little inn quite a long way from the airport. On the way to BKK the MLE handling agents refused to check us in saying that our ticket (issued by SriLankan) was for 15 days while our visa covered only 14. Right from the ticket agents to the transit hotels this was a ghastly experience.,12/14/2010,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,1
A Ahmed,1,NCL-DXB-DAC-DXB-NCL. Departed from NCL on newest 777-300ER with newest ICE system flight very full but experience was overall pleasant. Catering from NCL is generally always good there was nothing to complain about and staff were efficient and generally good if not over-friendly. Flight from DXB-DAC was on time and again very full on older 777-200 with older ICE system. Cabin Crew on this sector were excellent however and even checked in on my mother who had been upgraded to Business Class for us. Toilets in ridiculous state given 4 hour flight but again due to clientele rather than crews fault. Return was on Christmas Eve and surprisingly busy flight from DAC-DXB. Return flight is always over-timed by an hour - meant we didn't get on to the plane until an hour after arriving at the gate. Flight was on newer 777-200ER with newest ICE system. Cabin service was efficient and brusque if not necessarily very friendly and inflight catering was ok. Arrival into Dubai was early and the airport was very quiet - we had a wait of more than 4 hours for connection to NCL - so collected our complimentary food vouchers from transfer desk. DXB-NCL unusually on 3 class 777-300ER with newest ICE system. Cabin Crew were unusually mostly British due to a lot returning home for Christmas break. Catering was disappointing with choice particularly breakfast offering but otherwise pleasant. Arrival into NCL was late and held on tarmac for rather unusual amount of time before being parked at remote stand and bussed to terminal. Baggage out promptly. Would use again based on this experience - the sector DAC is never an easy one and on the whole Emirates made the experience rather more tolerable than it can be and the price was incredible value for money especially long-haul from a regional UK destination.,4/24/2014,5,3,4,5,4,9
A Bartlett,0,I flew from Manchester UK to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi on 18/19 Aug 2013. Worst flight I have had since I travelled Kenya airlines in the eighties! From Manchester seating was very uncomfortable. The flight to Bangkok was turned around as we taxied for take-off to decant two passengers who were headed for Jeddah not Bangkok! Delayed one and a half hours.,9/16/2013,1,1,2,2,1,1
A Bartlow,1,San Francisco to Tokyo return with our 2 month old son. They provided diapers and a bassinet for our son to sleep during the flight. The staff was very courteous and helped us before during and after the flight. We also had priority boarding because of our baby so we did not have to stay in line. They have individual TVs and the beverages are free unlike US airlines.,10/17/2011,5,5,5,5,5,10
A Baseley,0,Bristol - Guernsey return. Wonderful Flights comfortable seats 2x2 enough leg room to remain comfortable for the short 55 minute approx. flights. Little delay on Outward journey but nothing to cause concern or interference with the trip. Usual sea fog caused return flight to have a delay of around 1 hour 20 minutes nothing anyone can do about natures elements and Sunday Maintenance of the aircraft has to meet States regulations. Return flight was as comfortable as the Outward journey staff equally friendly. Would not hesitate to recommend Aurigny to other travellers to the beautiful Channel Islands Good to see the airline growing and modernising since the States took it over. Only downside to Air Travel between Islands as in to do day trips to different Islands via plane is the horrendous Taxes and Fuel Surcharges which made any chance of us visiting the other Islands impossible on price which is a shame as other Islands lost out on tourist spending which is important to the economy of the Islands.,6/17/2006,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Bastien,1,10-12-14 early flight SMF to SEA. Seats were thin but comfortable legroom seemed a bit more generous than the space I'm used to on other carriers seats had power outlets. I flew Alaska as part of a Delta flight from SMF- SEA-DTW-TVC the ticket purchased with my spouse's frequent flyer miles. I would choose to fly Alaska again over another airline even if the ticket price was higher. The aircraft didn't have entertainment. The food selection looked decent although I didn't buy any.,10/28/2014,4,4,3,1,4,8
A Ahmed,1,LGW-AMS-LGW. Price for the May Day Bank Holiday weekend was fantastic value. A small gripe is that you can't fully check-in online at the moment although seats selected up to 24hr prior to flight are usually honoured upon completing check-in at the airport and I know Garuda are working on this adding the ability to have mobile boarding passes. For now this does mean having to arrive a little early at the airport even if you only have hand baggage and completing check-in manually which is probably more of an issue on this short-hop sector than is likely for a full long-haul flight. Outbound this wasn't such an issue as there wasn't much of a queue but Inbound there was a considerable queue at Schiphol for economy check-in. Check-in staff were very efficient however and warm and friendly. Outbound flight left a little late with a short delayed arrival in Schiphol. Aircraft was an immaculately maintained fairly new 777-300ER in 9 abreast layout with good comfortable seating. The interior was beautifully designed and reflective of Indonesian culture. AVOD was ok although not as comprehensive as on some other carriers. Kept informed by Pilot and announcements in English Indonesian and Dutch. On both sectors Cabin Crew were great and immaculately presented. The crew on the inbound flight were much warmer which I preferred. The slight disappointment was the small snack served with only water which is virtually identical on both sectors. Whilst I don't expect anything on short-haul flights and have flown on low-cost carriers on flights that have cost more and not received anything this is a full service carrier with a 5-star rating and what was served was below the standard I was expecting from a full-service short-haul product. Small gripes aside I would use Garuda again.,5/10/2015,5,5,3,4,5,9
A Bastien,0,5/4/15 MSP-PHL MD 90. Rated food as a 1 because the inflight offerings do not appeal to me. When I've tried to purchase food items on previous flights the FAs have run out of the items I would have ordered. So I brought my own sandwich. I also brought my own beverage because FAs on a previous flight refused to sell me a bottle of wine for dinner told me to wait for the beverage cart's second round. Rated entertainment as 1 because there was none. The FAs were competent the aircraft clean and on time.,5/20/2015,1,3,2,1,3,6
A Ahmed,1,I found my trip from LHR-ISB very easy going and comfortable the flight left on time crew and staff were very enthusiastic and willing to help the plane itself was clean and presentable with great legroom a good amount of movies to choose from. In flight meals and snacks were efficiently given out and had plenty in terms of choice same on the return journey! The airline operates a more than generous 40kg allowance per passenger which is another added bonus.,7/22/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
A Ahmed,1,LHR-EDI-LHR. First time using a full service airline domestically after mostly using EasyJet for couple of years and this Little Red offshoot of VS didn't disappoint. Aer Lingus should given a massive pat of the back for the fantastic service they are delivering on behalf of Virgin Atlantic. Flights were on time and inflight service was more than one could ask for a short-haul domestic flight with friendly and attentive staff. I was delayed inbound back from Edinburgh but that was due to a security scare at that Airport and I was notified with plenty of time via email and text and allowed me time spend a few more hours with friends in Edinburgh. The one Achilles heel is Heathrow I haven't used Heathrow in 16 years - and I have to say it didn't leave me want to back in a hurry unfriendly and poor management of queues for security - for Britain's premier air gateway it is shambolic particularly when you see the improvements that have been made at Gatwick. Virgin should be proud of the service they are delivering here though I am using them again in January on this domestic route and will be sad to see this end in September 2015. Great service and excellent value - highly recommended.,12/31/2014,5,5,5,5,5,10
A Bastien,0,5/9/15 SLC-SMF Airbus A320. My spouse let me sit in her first class seat. It was a disappointment: legroom not much better than Economy Comfort although the seat was wider and had more recline. The food was also disappointing same snacks as the ones given to Economy Comfort passengers. On the positive side the FA brought me a glass of wine when requested unlike my main cabin experiences in which FAs will not bring me a small bottle for wine (even if purchased) until the beverage cart makes its rounds. I didn't pay for this first class travel but if I had I would have been even more disappointed. My trip satisfaction is less than it was for my Economy Comfort flights because first class failed to meet my expectations. I rated entertainment as 1 because there wasn't any.,5/20/2015,1,4,1,1,4,2
A Alagoa,1,Just last week I was on another Kenya Airways flight but this time the experience far from what I'd expected. The aircraft itself had only just returned to Nairobi with a full load of passengers about an hour before we boarded it. Of course it had been prepared for our flight but not well enough - the toilet I used even before departure was grubby the carpeting on the floor of the passenger cabin still had tiny remnants of a food spill from the previous flight the inflight entertainment system worked only partly - the flight tracker did not work at all throughout the 8 hr flight to Amsterdam - the choice in movies and music was so limited and the sound quality so inadequate. A far cry from the very enjoyable flight on the KLM B747-400 that had flown me on the outward leg. But the food was fairly good and there was one or two particularly attractive flight attendants.,5/7/2014,4,3,4,2,4,5
A Bastien,0,TPA to LAX on 12-10-14 B737 Economy Comfort another routine Delta Flight. Uncomfortable seats with slightly more legroom than economy but with minimum recline. I give Delta low ratings on account of the uncomfortable seats. Otherwise it's pretty much like other U.S. carriers. Food for purchase. I didn't buy any so rated it at one star. Charge for entertainment headphones didn't buy a set so I also rated entertainment at one star. I fly Delta only because my spouse has Platinum FF status and buys my tickets with her FF miles. Otherwise I'd like to try other airlines.,1/5/2015,3,1,1,1,3,4
A Al-Ani,0,Although seats are very good there are severe limitations: Istanbul Airport offers no extra tracks for Business class passengers which means that you have to line up with all the others in the middle of the night/early in the morning (usually) to pass the overcrowded security checks. There is a fast track lane but it was always closed when I needed to pass it (4 times in the past 2 months). Istanbul airport is deplorable not coping with the rapid expansion of TK. This means that your expensive Business class experiences finds a rather unpleasant middle piece. Even more disturbing is the very wrong catering service concept and staff quality. Usually one pays for an expensive business class seat to find rest and piece and some sleep. TK assumes that you are in it for the culinary experience and serve food regardless of the flying time thus limiting the rest time severely. For instance while flying from Istanbul to Cape Town TK started serving dinner at midnight for over 3 hours. Then they wake you up 2 hours before landing to serve breakfast. Even worse is that the crew is serving and removing the food very noisily moving plates glasses etc for hours. The 11 hours flight to Cape Town thus had only 3 hours of quite sleeping time. Worst affected are the first and last rows of the business class being close to the pantry. Another bad example was the flight from Istanbul to Doha: here same procedure: although guests wanted to sleep right after the take-off (midnight again). Food was served almost the entire flight (4 hours). Noise was unbearable as the pantry did not even had a shielding curtain. Besides the fact that the food is nothing special the quality of the crews is very heterogeneous. During the flight to Doha the chief cabin attendant was reading the newspaper drank tea in front of the business class passengers (no curtain) and was observing leisurely the work of his subordinates. The staff chats constantly with each other and although there are more than enough attendants on board it is not possible to place a successful request as the chain of command is long and unclear responsibilities seem to exist.,1/13/2014,4,5,1,4,2,4
A Bastien,0,Mid August. YYZ-MSP-SMF (Toronto - Minneapolis - Sacramento). Return trip. The economy comfort seats from MSP to SMF were adequate decent legroom acceptable recline. Other than legroom they were not much different from the ones on Endeavor Air / Delta Connection from YYZ to MSP. The plastic armrests from MSP-SMF were very uncomfortable. These seats are similar to the ones on Delta international flights. I will no longer fly Delta on internationally and will try another carrier such as KLM on my next trip to Europe. One star for food and entertainment (I didn't buy food no entertainment offered). The flight attendants were competent and courteous.,9/6/2014,2,2,1,1,5,3
A Alhilou,1,I booked to travel from MAN to AUH on EY22 on 20th Dec. I called EY's call centre to upgrade using miles/cash to business where I was assured that there are plenty of seats available and should head to the airport 3 hrs before departure to process this. The information given was completely incorrect as the desks opened 4 hrs before departure and all seats were taken by then which was very frustrating and disappointing. EY ground staff and EY's Business class lounge staff at MAN acknowledged the mishap and were very courteous and attentive and attempted to solve this problem. Return flight on EY21 on the 29th of December light load in J class we were well looked after by the excellent crew in J. as usual EY's catering is excellent cabin crew attentive and good hard product. I just wish they sort out the unhelpful call centre and bring back the old amenity kits in J class with Aigner products that were infinitely better than the current cheap substitutes.,1/2/2014,4,5,5,4,5,8
A Ali,0,Travelled economy plus to Lahore from Mnachester Lahore to Bahawalpur the following day. Boeing 777. The seats were more comfortable than economy and service was excellent. Hot food friendly stewards and great IFE. Cabin crew were attentive catering for the needs of my 2 year old daughter. Lahore to Bahawalpur was better experience as the plane was half empty. Return journey the same. But the accommodation for the transit passengers was not good.,4/9/2007,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Allaga,1,Manila to Singapore very smooth and on time. Friendly and smiling cabin crew. The captain kept us updated of the weather situation en route to Singapore. With ticket less than $USD40 to Singapore I couldn't ask for more.,5/10/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
A Bastien,0,May 1 2014 Washington DC (DCA) to Minneapolis St. Paul (MSP). I bought an economy class ticket but Delta gave me an economy plus seat. Economy plus had a little more legroom and padding than economy but the seat recline was almost the same as in economy - I couldn't tell the difference. Based on this experience I would not pay extra for economy plus. Delta charged $2.00 for headsets with which to listen to a movie displayed on overhead screens situated every 4-6 rows. I didn't buy the headsets or food so I can't comment on catering or entertainment. Boarding has turned into an unpleasant experience passengers crowding the gate so they can board first and secure overhead bin space. My flight experience deteriorates each time I fly Delta. My spouse is a Platinum frequent flyer which is the only reason I patronize this airline -- no cost award tickets. I can't wait to fly Southwest or Jet Blue (domestic) or Air France KLM Lufthansa international. It seems as though the smiling CEO on the inflight video has nothing but contempt for his economy class passengers.,5/4/2014,1,2,1,1,4,2
A Almarza,0,Horrible experience yesterday at Newark! Our flight was moved four times to a different gate and then cancelled - no explanation. Customer service was appalling and abrasive and I was even threatened with the Port Authority Police when I demanded to know the reason for the cancellation. At the end I had to sleep at the airport after a long international trip. Please save yourself the aggravation and book your next flight with a real airline!,5/17/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Alotaibi,0,DXB-BAH-LHR return I bought this flight due to the fairly low price. The flight was awful on the way out really dated aircraft horrible food and I forgot about the old IFE system - felt like I was back in the 1990's! The return flight was okay not so different although this time we had a choice of meals and it was a bit more welcoming also frequent offers of drinks after meal. The cabin crew were good no complaints about them but what a shame for Gulf Air.,3/7/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,2
A Bastien,0,April 27th overnight flight from San Francisco (SFO) to Washington Reagan (DCA) with stopover in Detroit (DTW). Economy seats on flight from SFO to DTW were extremely uncomfortable: hardly any legroom - very little padding no padding on armrests and minimal recline. These are the worst airline seats I've experienced. Delta offered a thin blanket but no pillow. I was unable to sleep. The economy seats from DTW to DCA had slightly more recline and were therefore tolerable. Delta didn't offer food for purchase on these flights and I didn't pay the $2.00 for a headset on the SFO to DTW flight so I am unable to rate food or entertainment (I gave Delta one star for each).,5/3/2014,1,1,1,1,4,1
A Aloysius,1,SEA-LHR and AMS-SEA I had an excellent experience on these international flights with Delta. The seats were relatively spacious and comfortable and the IFE was really impressive. The food was edible and there were frequent drink services. I had a far better experience than I did with Air Canada on similar routes. I will definitely be flying with Delta on future trips to Europe.,9/9/2014,5,4,3,5,4,8
A Althani,0,Upgraded from business to first class I wish they had not. I have a problematic lower back - the First Class suite is very private but the seat gave very little lower back support and for me the business class seat is more comfortable. The staff on board were very attentive and helpful the Chef came and saw I was not interested in the meal options so he offered to make me a Teryiaki Chicken which was delicious although the Pumpkin Soup was lacking in both consistency and taste. The cooler wasn't working on the personal mini bar and those two drinks were undrinkable. The entertainment system was good - it had a few nice classics and also a very good selection on new releases . We arrived with a ten minute delay into Abu Dhabi from Paris CDG but my connecting flight into Doha was delayed by an hour because a few passengers checked in their luggage but did not make the flight. Etihad has excellent on board service but airport services baggage handling and crisis management really let their passengers down!,9/17/2014,3,1,5,2,5,6
A Bastien,1,SMF to SLC - premium economy on Delta's regional carrier Skywest. In my experience seats on Skywest are more comfortable than the ones on Delta's larger aircraft. However the recline is minimal. Pleasant flight on time flight no food for purchase.,1/5/2015,3,3,1,1,3,8
A Althani,0,We flew today from Doha to Venice on Etihad via Abu Dhabi and Rome the flight from Rome to Venice was on Alitalia code share the service on Etihad was very good but again they failed to warn us that baggage handling in Rome were on strike and we ended up arriving in Venice and getting ready to go on a cruise short of three bags why they keep failing to warn their passengers with equipment issues and service problems is just horrible I think I need to take my business elsewhere from now onwards! Please do not take my criticism wrongly Etihad's service on board is one of the best in the business but the end result is what lasts and when you end up in a hotel room getting ready to get on a long awaited cruise holiday without your clothes you begin to ask yourself why on earth did I fly with these people and why did they not re-route me when they knew about the problem but still took the risk with my holiday!,8/11/2014,2,5,5,5,5,2
A Bastien,1,SLC to OKC. My spouse gave me her first class (upgrade) boarding pass. I can't comment on value for money because this was a free ticket. However first class was disappointing no food served or available for purchase on a flight that boarded at 1:20pm. (we had a one-hour layover). The seats were wider than those in EC and with more legroom. I'd fly Skywest again but would not pay for a first class ticket. Other than the lack of food the flight was pleasant the FAs attentive and courteous.,1/5/2015,3,5,1,1,4,7
A Althani,1,I flew from Doha to Paris connecting in Frankfurt the brand new product with the slightly angled flat bed seats was offered on this A330-300 on the Doha to Frankfurt sector but I was told that not all flights on this route have the new product the seats are comfortable in the sitting and reclining position but not long enough for me when it is turned into a bed. The foot rest was very narrow the IFE screen was big but the movie and TV selection was not too big. Food was good and the portions where generous I enjoyed the crepe for breakfast no amenity kit was offered. Flight attendants were professional when needed they were present but otherwise they did not bother you when watching a TV program or a movie as does happen on other airlines. The flight from Frankfurt to Paris was on time comfortable and all our bags came through.,12/22/2014,5,3,4,3,5,9
A Althani,1,Flew DOH-JED-DOH in Business Class. Service was very good IFE was adequate and easy to operate food was also average. Seats on the A320 were very comfortable and price was excellent when compared with the competition - the luggage allowance was very generous. I will use them on this route as the overall package is very attractive!,3/13/2013,5,5,3,3,4,10
A Bate,0,"Unless the traveler is truly desperate for the very lowest fare and can fit into a very small seat and carry only one ""personal item"" the bag and seat fees add up so fast that we ended up paying about the same as for larger and more efficiently run airlines. The airline staff on the ground and in the air appeared overburdened and exhausted. I will say the flight crew did seem alert and chipper. Even if I could have avoided the additional fees it would not have been worth the poor service cumbersome website awkward information interface and ineffective communications. The final indignation was that several hours after having moved our departure to a different gate on the concourse someone had neglected to notify the push-away cart of the change. This dropped ball resulted in a completely avoidable further twenty minute delay while we sat on the aircraft waiting for it to get to the new gate to push our aircraft away from the gate. We had already determined that we would not fly this airline again but this experience really was the last straw. It's too bad - Southwest has figured out how to keep fares a little more reasonable and they do it with flair.",8/8/2014,1,1,1,1,2,2
A Althani,1,Doha-Jeddah then onto Madina return. We used their new A320 which was furnished with their new short range product and we where surprised of how good and comfortable their plane was and helpful and attentive their staff were. A very nice choice of meal service though they did not offer a menu but the portions where large compared with other airlines and I plan on using them again.,7/12/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
A Althani,0,Business Class SAA code share with Emirates DXB-JNB-DUR return. All in all there were 7 Business Class passengers the service and the IFE on the 777-300ER was excellent the food was good the seating quite narrow. The service in JNB and DUR was nothing less than terrible.,9/22/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,7
A Bates,1,London-Mauritius return on 23rd Jan. Plane only half full so lots of space my son had a bad tooth and was looked after very well.

A Al-Thani,1,DOH-AUH-JNB return. Flight out to JNB was fantastic first leg on an Airbus A320 from Doha to Abu Dhabi a short flight that went smoothly. The were people to meet and assist at Abu Dhabi the connection was very smooth and the onward flight was on a newly refurbished A330 with the newest product in Business Class and the food was superb as was the IFE. Cabin staff were excellent and addressed us by our name I would like Etihad to give a much better amenity kit than the very poor one they give out right now. On the return it was nothing short of a disaster on all levels after arriving at JNB airport and getting our tax work done and checking in our luggage the lady at check in tells us that we will not be flying on Etihad but on Air Seychelles. I would have appreciated it if Etihad would have contacted me before I left my hotel and told me of the situation and given me a choice. The seats on the flight were uncomfortable and very hard though the leg room was good the sleeping position was terrible as it was not straight and the IFE was terrible the screen was very small and the selection was poor I refused to have a meal and just had a glass of Orange juice. I was contacted by Etihad after arrival and they offered me an apology which I accepted I will give Etihad another chance but they could have handled the situation so much better than they did.,1/14/2014,4,4,5,3,3,7
A Baugh,0,Heathrow-Sri Lanka return direct and had both the worst and best business flights I have had thus far. On the outward journey the plane was so old it had ashtrays and awful seats which were definitely not adequate for long-haul by today's standards. On top of which the TV was in the seatback of the seat in front so consequently when they reclined you could not see the screen. My screen only worked on 1 channel so I had 1 film to watch on an 11 hour flight and my husband's TV didn't work at all. On the return journey it could not have been more different. Excellent lie-flat beds great food great amount of channels to watch superb flight! I suggest you ring the airline before hand to check that the aircraft will be a lie-flat before you book!,4/3/2013,2,1,3,1,4,5
A Alzuhairi,1,DXB-DOH-DXB Outbound on new 737-800 with AVOD IFE. Excellent system were you pay for what you want to watch. Short programs to full length movies cost between $2 - $7. Games and following flight path is free. Food onboard was adequate and reasonably priced. All flights arrived early and were 70% full. Leg room was quite tight but it is a low cost airlines. Dubai Terminal 2 is reasonable with a good variety of shops and restaurants. Cost was 30% of other airlines and definitely worth it.,1/20/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
A Amaladoss,1,LGW-VRN-LGW both in Club Europe. Was offered an upgrade on the way out for Â£85. Swift check-in as Gatwick was quiet at 6.30am. Used the Galleries lounge-reasonable cold food selection but the only hot option was porridge. Nice atmosphere though and good views of the runway. Left slightly late due to congestion. Nice breakfast with individual bottles of Heidseck Monopole champagne. No aerobridges at Verona so had to walk to a bus in the rain. Bags delivered quickly. Return flight was delayed by an hour as the incoming flight was late. BA use the Catullo lounge which is very poor with an abysmal selection of food-nothing hot not even a sandwich just biscuits and pastries at 9pm! The lounge is before the security check so not able to relax altogether. Crew very apologetic about delay speedy drinks and meal service-the chicken curry was passable.,5/7/2014,4,4,4,1,5,7
A Amin,0,March 26 2015 JFK-AUH flight 102 and Apr 4 2015 AUH-JFK flight 101. To AUH boarding was total chaos. Jet Airways staff were curt and not properly stocked. Had ordered kids meals for my 3 kids but none were given - I had to go up to the galley and ask for them personally. Food was well below my expectations. Returning AUH-JFK was terrible. Check-in took 45 minutes because the agent couldn't print our baggage tags. Boarding and the US ICE Pre- clearance was a breeze and we were among the first to board. My wife a doctor herself 6 months pregnant and traveling with a letter from her physician clearing her for travel suffered the most. Once onboard and in our seats a flight attendant noticed my wife was pregnant and asked for her letter. Flight attendant said that the letter was insufficient (remember that this was the return flight - had already been allowed to fly to AUH and had checked-in at the desk gone through two security checkpoints US Customs and the gate agent) and tried to kick her off the flight. After a ground crew member came to ask about our bags (to remove them from the aircraft) and realizing that they would have to remove 7 passengers and 14 checked bags they allowed us to stay but only after delaying the flight for an hour. Food on the return flight was terrible. Small portions poor selection (didn't give us a menu at all). Considering that the return was a 14 hour flight they should have given us more food during the voyage. At least the rest of the cabin crew was relatively nicer but not overly so. Lavatories were actually kept in decent shape and they gave us plenty of water to drink. Upon arrival at JFK the gate staff was rude pushy and noticeably cranky. Will never fly Etihad again.,4/10/2015,1,2,1,3,1,1
A Bazelian,1,ODS-SVO-IAD Economy. Great value if you want a good price good food and don't mind not having the latest IFE or can read Russian newspapers. Security can be slow transferring at Sheremetyevo but then again international transfers at USA airports are slow too. Plane for about a 2 hour time to make transfers when in terminal D. Staff on the legs I was on were friendly and helpful. It helps a lot to speak Russian or at least some Russian words.,10/15/2013,5,3,5,3,5,9
A Anders,0,Flew JFK-DMD-ALA and back. The flying stock is old and outdated. Broken seats and trays. Smelly unsanitary lavatories. No entertainment provided during the transatlantic flights unless you paid $20 for a portable player. Attendants are full of attitude and in need of training on courteous service. I wouldn't feed livestock with the meals they serve. Basically you get what you paid for. Cheap but not worth it.,8/30/2012,2,1,2,1,2,2
A Beardsley,1,Great flights! I must admit I had my concerns about travelling with Norwegian after reading some reviews on here but our experience on the 787 Dreamliner was great. We flew London Gatwick to Fort Lauderdale departed on time had pleasant cabin crew great inflight entertainment and the best beef steak I have ever tasted! We decided to upgrade on check-in to Premium Economy and if this option is available I would highly recommend. We paid an extra Â£180 each to upgrade at last minute and it was worth every penny. The only downside was the delay once we had landed at Fort Lauderdale. Although we landed on time Passport Control and Customs could not handle the sheer volume of passengers/aircraft arriving at the airport at the same time. We were kept waiting a further 2 hours on the aircraft as airport staff would not let us disembark. In total it was 4 hours after landing before we were able to leave Fort Lauderdale airport to begin our holiday. This was the case for every arrival and was not the fault of Norwegian Airlines but it ruined what was otherwise a perfect flight. The return flight back to London Gatwick was again faultless and on time. From landing back to the car took less than hour - what a difference!,9/17/2014,5,4,4,4,4,10
A Anderson,0,"BA362 6th June 2015. If this were the first flight I had taken with British Airways I would not be impressed. At check in there is a lack of professionalism. The customer does not come first even at the First Class check in. Staff interrupt each other and discuss their own business in priority to completing the check in. The flight was in fact delayed by an hour despite the information such as was provided given as ""ten minutes"". The aircraft appeared dated and not especially clean with crumbs on the seat and grease marks on the windows. The inflight shopping was made difficult as there were no inflight duty free magazines available in Club Class. Inflight entertainment system did not work. Whilst the food was good it had to be changed as the first offering was cold. Inflight crew were pleasant and efficient. Upon arrival the baggage reclaim took no account of priority passengers.",6/7/2015,3,3,4,1,3,4

A Beattie,0,I flew Israir and was thoroughly disappointed. I did not mind the extra random searches that took an extra hour and included 5 physical searches from different people. What I did mind was that they took my luggage and searched it without me being present and also they took all my hand luggage and left me with nothing for the flight (I flew from Berlin to Tel Aviv.) The flight itself was unbearable. we were crammed in so tight that there was absolutely no room to move and when the person in front of me reclined his seat I could not eat properly. the food was sub-par and the passengers seemed to never be in their seats. I will never recommend them to anyone,1/21/2008,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,1
A Andersson,0,Stockholm ARN to New York JFK. The dreamliner had been replaced by A340. Seats OK but inflight video system out of order. Meal service was a joke. After almost 3 hours we were served a light meal and one glass of wine. No possibility to buy anything else until meal trays had been cleared and bar trolleys where rolled out. By then we were 2 hours from landing in New York! If I have to fly with this airline again I will stock up with own water and food.,6/9/2013,2,3,1,1,2,1

A Becker,1,Gainesville to Miami non-stop. Gainesville airport is only serviced by three airlines so my choices were limited. Flight was OK a 64 seat ATR-72 showing its age but in decent shape. The flight was 1hr 20mins but we were still served drinks. American Eagle is good in that you can pick your seat when you book the ticket online unlike some airlines which charge you. A warning though the ATR-72 has overhead bins but they are too small for regular carry-on bags. Things like backpacks and purses will fit but that's about it. If you do have a standard luggage carry on you will check it in right before you get to the plane and once you get off the plane it'll be there waiting for you. The ATR-72 boards from the back of the plane so pick seats in the back and you'll be off the plane first.,1/17/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,7
A Angell,1,Flying from Oslo Rygge to Stansted several times a year. Never any problems Flights on time or even before schedule. Last trip 18 March to London and return 23 March.

A Anjou,1,Frankfurt-Zanzibar with a stopover in Nairobi. Condor's Business Class is not on par with other competitors but it only costs a fraction of the price. Interior was clean and crew friendly meals were alright. My only disappointment was that we were allocated new seats for the (short) Nairobi-Zanzibar leg because of some passengers disembarking and joining. I had originally chosen a window seat but found myself on an aisle seat.,8/10/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,7
A Beeby,1,MAN-DOH-SIN return. All flights arrived on time but very poor boarding arrangements in DOH and SIN and mixed aircraft experience marred the trip! A330 is quiet and fairly spacious but was showing serious signs of age B777 was a much better flying experience with much more space and comfort and the B787 was a big let down. Despite the good mood lighting and darkened windows on the B787 the manufacturers seem to have used such flimsy and lightweight components that it just doesn't seem as if it is going to last. Plastic panels in three toilets were split as were two panels around the cabin window toilet seat broken in one sink blocked in two seats flex and creek and aisle is way too narrow. The cabin service was good and consistent throughout the food quality was mixed (as usual) champagne on flights from UK is a nice touch and decent wine served throughout remaining flights. However all of the above comments pale into insignificance compared to the loathsome experience of Doha airport; it is truly awful. And no one from QR can say when this sorry airport state will end.,1/28/2014,4,4,4,5,5,7
A Anne,1,JFK-MEX-ZIH and return. JFK-MEX on the red eye was completed on an older model 737 with no inflight entertainment (presumably due to the timing of the flight - depart 12.15am arrive 4.40am) but we were served a very nice hot sandwich shortly after takeoff. MEX-JFK return on a brand-new 737 - great plane excellent inflight entertainment and again a nice hot meal. The ZIH-MEX connection was slightly delayed but we were assured that a significant amount of passengers on the flight were connecting to the JFK flight. Sure enough about 18 of us were greeted by an agent upon deplaning in MEX and were escorted as a group to the JFK gate which was in the process of boarding. Excellent service throughout by both ground and cabin crews. Would not hesitate to recommend Aeromexico in the future.,3/12/2014,5,5,5,4,5,10
A Antonyan,0,I traveled with my children (9 and 5 year old) from Sochi - Moscow - LAX. My experience was horrible. I nicely asked for good seats because I was with 2 children. The worker answered that she could not help me because the computer chooses the seats. Given seats 35K 35G and 35H. At first look it seems normal but when we got to the plane it was shocking. One seat was window side the other two in the middle row. Where is the logic? Where is the common sense and customer care? This was a 12 hour flight.,9/6/2014,0,0,3,3,3,NaN

There is no one at 8pm in SXM airport so we waited to get some information for our luggage. One hour later some LIAT agents appeared and told us that our luggage was still in Tortola. Fortunately we stayed one night in SXM so we told the agent to deliver us the bag to our hotel ""no problem"". Next day we waited the whole morning nothing happened. After several calls to LIAT and the airport we were told that our bag was in the airport and that we can pick it up there.

A Arcosi,0,A word of advice - if you want to go on holiday never go by Vueling! I tried to get to Barcelona today but I am still at home. After waiting from 2am to 8am in various queues at the airport we were told the flight was cancelled. This is not a reliable company and it's not cheap either!

A Bell,1,Once again flown London to Brisbane return via Bangkok and the service and cabin ambience in economy was brilliant. Main strength is the cabin ambience (food and beverage selection AVOD and hygiene). The newly retrofitted 747s are very comfortable and AVOD has a good selection of entertainment. I would strongly recommend Thai Airways as it always is a pleasant experience.,9/1/2013,4,5,5,4,5,10
A Bellet,0,I've flown for 10 years from Paris to HKG every month at least twice a month. I've seen the service quality whether in economy or business class drastically going down from 2009. The food has become much poorer quantity and quality-wise. The temperature in cabin was very cold and most of the time no more blankets left even for my 9 year old daughter. The online booking does not show you complete routes when booking a ticket. Example: HK to Singapore they don't mention there is a stop in Bangkok. So you just get the surprise at check-in. If you want to upgrade from your miles you need to buy a more expansive ticket and even then you are not sure you can be upgraded. Even as a frequent flyer of this company it became almost impossible to book a front row seat over the years. Before as a Marco Polo gold member I could easily get any seat I required. Will never will fly with them again.,4/22/2014,2,2,1,4,1,1
A Bennett,0,Booked a package holiday and flew from London Gatwick to Zakynthos (Zante). The flight out was good friendly staff but no entertainment. No reps to greet us at the airport. The flight back to Gatwick was a different story. At Zante airport an announcement came over the tannoy saying that all those in seat rows 1 to 29 to board at the front of the plane and the rest to the back of the plane. We were in row 29 therefore obviously we would board at the front of the plane. When we walked in to the plane we got greeted by an unhappy air hostess who told me off for boarding the wrong end of the plane even though this was what we were told. This made us feel very unwelcome onboard. After take off we waited a very long time before drinks and snacks were bought round. They then said we could all fill out a questionnaire regarding Thomas Cook. The air hostess started distributing these but when she got to about row 28 she just walked straight past and ignored the fact that I would have liked to complete one. She seemed stressed and far from happy and lacked customer service. I asked one of the other air hostess's if I could have a questionnaire to complete and she was more than happy to get me one and apologised. The unhappy air hostess then came round collecting rubbish but once again missed us out so we sat for the rest of the trip with cups and wrappers on our tables. There was definitely very much a lack of customer service and polite attitude from one of the air hostesses which you don't really expect when you are a customer. I appreciate everyone has an off day but you still have to be polite to others especially in this kind of work.,9/22/2014,3,3,3,0,3,2
A Bergmann,1,Four flights IST-ALA-TSE-ALA-KUL. All 4 were on time excellent service by cabin crew very good food and drink selection - both on domestic and international legs. Good seat comfort (cradle seats on shorter sectors angled lie flat on B767 to KUL). The only disappointment was the lounge in ALA which is basically a bar and you get a voucher for a soft drink plus a snack.,3/29/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
A Berry,0,Seat was hard thin padding and armrest controls were annoying bare cabin. Seat not wide enough for thighs to rest on and I am 53. Seats very close together. Crew were kind. We flew from Toronto to Dublin and I would not use this airline again. We tried to contact the airline to upgrade in case we were on Rouge to return and could not reach them overnight in Dublin but fortunately we took a regular Air Canada from Heathrow to Vancouver - Heathrow not greatest airport for flight changes with heavy security.,11/3/2014,2,1,1,1,2,4
A Berthoud,0,I recently traveled from Denver to Vegas for the first time on Spirit Airlines. As soon as I got to the airport I was not only surprised by the $40 checked bag fee but the $50 carry on fee. But knowing that a lot of airlines are charging bag fees I paid and moved on. We got to the seating section of the check in and it offered for me to select a seat for additional money or have it randomly picked. I was traveling with someone but thought surely they wouldn't separate passengers traveling together. I was wrong. Then of course they couldn't even offer a free drink. My seat just fit me and I had to have my arms crossed the entire flight. On the flight home I paid $81.00 for a checked bag and the privilege of sitting next to the person I was traveling with. The only positive was the flight attendants traveling home who were extremely funny. I will never fly this airlines again and will be sure to tell anyone thinking of flying with them not to.,12/22/2014,1,1,1,1,2,1
A Beswick,1,LGW-BGI return (747 + A330) in Economy. Both trips were very good indeed. Staff were really in to their jobs friendly helpful attentive. Entertainment food and seats a lot better than the competition. Took extra legroom seats on return and well worth Â£20 pp supplement.,3/19/2014,3,4,4,5,4,9
A Biedel,0,We arrived at LAX for at 9am for a 10.55am flight to Provo UT (80 minute flight). We have now been informed that the flight is not scheduled to leave until 6.25pm. I am a 40 year old woman and have flown all my life and I have never experienced this type of a delay especially for this short of a flight. Allegiant is cheap but this is inexcusable. I am traveling with a toddler and as it stands right now we have spent over 7 hours at the airport and will probably be here at least 2 more hours if not more. No one will let us know what is going on.,9/1/2014,1,2,2,1,2,NaN
A Arman,0,Trip was Stockholm to Dubai via Doha (Economy class). Flow with the new 787 Dreamliner and as many have written here the seats are quite bad. Really disappointing since I had higher expectations on Qatar Airways. The seats are small legroom is tight and the IFE-box takes up to much space. The entertainment-system is good food and service is also good. Also flew with their A330 which is more comfortable but the entertainment system is really old now. Their best airplanes are without doubt the Boeing 777 which is both comfortable and modern. That's the plane I recommend if you travel with Qatar Airways. But for me I will choose another carrier next time.,3/20/2015,4,3,5,3,5,7
A Bishop,0,Ryanair's business model appears to me to revolve around cheap ticket pricing with highly complicated and rigid terms and conditions which the majority of people will fall foul of thus allowing Ryanair to introduce additional costs hence restoring their profits. Placed a booking Ryanair changed the rules between the time I placed my booking and date of flying which meant they expect me to receive return flight boarding cards by email whilst on holiday and then try to get the hotel to print them out for me. There are too many ifs buts and maybes in that scenario so alternatively - pay 13 per person to be able to print boarding cards before we leave the UK.,5/21/2014,2,2,0,NaN,2,2
A Arndt,0,DEN-MLI (United branded flight). Had to walk outside to board plane which is fine. However left 15 minutes late since 3 other planes boarding from same gate at same time and people getting on wrong planes. CRJ-200 extremely outdated interior and air conditioning inoperable. FA told us to close shades for entire flight to keep plane from heating up which helped. Cabin crew pleasant. While I would say worst flight I have been on subtle nuances made up for it somewhat.,6/12/2008,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,1
A Arnold,0,Connecting flight out of Charlotte supposed to take off at 10.11pm delayed until 11.30 due to no crew - get boarded only to have to defuel for over an hour. Then the mechanical problems started for another 2 hours so 3 hours sitting in the plane at the gate - only to get deboarded. It is now 3am no explanations no water no snacks. Get reboarded at 4.30am - sit for another hour - get deboarded yet again! They say they have until 10am to cancel the flight. If they don't cancel you will pay for any other flights. There aren't any flights until the day after tomorrow no hotels either. Airport/airplane for 10.5 hours past original flight time. Instead of being apologetic and nice they acted like they were doing us all a favor by letting us sit in our seats. Another US air flight was cancelled earlier in the evening due to mechanical issues as well - guess they were tired of dealing with us.,4/29/2014,1,3,1,1,1,NaN
A Bjorndalen,1,Booked several weeks in advance for a trip from Minot ND to Las Vegas. We paid for advanced seat selection and a checked luggage item at the time of booking. The Allegiant website and online check-in app were incredibly easy and intuitive. I did have difficulty getting the boarding pass to load with the app at first but a couple of tries later it worked. The check in agent in Minot wore a Frontier Airlines uniform and generally was kind of ignorant. The Minot terminal was very cold. The flight was delayed briefly for an issue with an inbound passenger but eventually left about 20 minutes late. Flight was uneventful and went by quickly. I found the MD-83 to be actually quite comfortable even though the seats didn't recline. There was no inflight entertainment system but the onboard magazine was decent and even contained Vegas coupons! We arrived only a little late. The crew was efficient and friendly and even cracked a couple jokes over the PA on arrival and bags dispensed quickly. On the return flight check-in and boarding were pleasant and quick and we left on time. The airplane however was absolutely filthy! The seats were worn the tray tables were slopped all over and even the window had food on it. We had the same crew situation as outbound in that they were efficient friendly and helpful. On arrival to Minot we were early but luggage took 30 minutes to dispense. In the end yes this airline is acceptable. They're certainly inexpensive and the crews are on par with most other carriers. If you want to save up to a few hundred dollars I'm sure you can put up with buying your soda onboard.,12/10/2014,5,3,3,1,4,7
A Arora,1,Return journey to Amritsar via Delhi in economy class. First leg from LHR-DEL-ATQ was not impressive. They didn't give bottles of water bottles but two pouches of dairy powder and concentrated milk were given on the first leg. The return flight was enjoyable on 24th Sep and proper meals were served with water bottles. The inflight service was good apart from snacks which were served too late. They need to improve dessert. The ticket had allowance for 2 bags but website was showing only 1 bag. There is a lack of communication on the part of airline on baggage issues. The in flight entertainment was enjoyable with a good selection of movies. The transfer at Delhi for Amritsar was ok as airline didn't bother to tell us that aircraft has been delayed on first leg.,9/24/2013,4,4,4,4,4,5
A Blagrove,1,Auckland to Buenos Aires. Plane was delayed by five hours after we'd checked in with pretty much no explanation (except that the incoming plane from Sydney was delayed but again no explanation why). We were travelling with two young children so the delays were a bit difficult. Legroom was pretty much as I remember other airlines in economy class. The lack of decent entertainment was a pain (only the old monitors up in the aisles where you had to crane your neck to see) but the kids ended up falling asleep anyway. And the movie they played was in Spanish. Dinner was acceptable. Kids had a kids meal as requested. It was disappointing there was no beverage service during the night for those who were awake. I went hunting for a drink of water hoping they'd give me a bottle to tide me over but no just a cup. Having said all that the staff were reasonably friendly and the fare was much cheaper. It saved us around $1200 as a family. So if you don't mind no-frills it's not a bad choice. The domestic leg from Buenos Aires to Lima was on time and efficient.,6/23/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,5
A Arrants,0,I had a voucher from Allegiant that I had from January 2013 and had to use by Jan 2015 which I did the end of October 2013. They had already charged me $80.00 for voucher issue which they deducted. Very hard to use website in booking a flight. I chose my seats which I paid for did not get the ones I signed up for on my departure flight. Then I made a typo scheduling my return on 12/22(was supposed to come back on 11/3. Not their fault on that. When I had to change it they charged me for seats again adding $342.00 in fees for my wife and myself. The seats don't recline nor or they comfortable. Very cheap. Will hitch hike before ever using them.,11/12/2013,2,3,0,0,4,1
A Arriens,0,Good on time performance. Wished to have a second warm meal on board an intercontinental flight then just a breakfast. Very noisy cabin due insulation on the 737. Crew seemed unorganized and hasty. IFE wasn't working properly.,11/20/2013,3,3,2,2,2,5
A Blanco,0,I was very disappointed with Aerolineas Argentinas. The seats are very uncomfortable they do not have enough space between them vertically. My husband is 6 feet tall and his legs were touching the front seat he had no space to move them. I am 5'5 and was also uncomfortable. It was a long flight almost 9 hours and the TV screens did not function properly. Mine had no image whatsoever. My husband's screen had image but no sound. No entertainment at all for almost 9 hours is ridiculous. We had to take a second flight from Buenos Aires to Bahia Blanca and the flight was delayed 2 hours. On our return from Buenos Aires to Miami the flight was also delayed this time for 1 hour. Even tough the prices of Aerolineas Argentinas are lower I would never use it again or recommended to anybody. I have taken the same flight route with American Airlines and LAN and they are much better. Next time I rather pay more for the tickets and have a more pleasant and comfortable flight.,5/11/2015,2,1,3,1,2,3
A Arriens,1,"Starters (cold), assorted Turkish appetizers. All was fairly tasty. Cheese was nice and of an acceptable quality. Bread was nice. Main (warm) Grilled salmon and sea bass fillet, sauteed prawn (leaf spinach / parsley potatoes) - all fish had taste. Crew service friendly, adequate, they listen to what you have to say and always smile. They offer a welcome drink, or 2 if you like. These crew walked around the cabin wishing passengers a nice flight and a nice meal. This crew spoke and understood English better than my previous experiences, a much needed improvement. They understand their product, can tell you about it, for instance: I asked two simple questions: Where the wines were from and where the design of the meals came from. ",7/3/2015,4,4,4,4,4,9
A Bland,0,London Luton - Belgrade return. The airline kept changing the days of travel (not just the times) 'for commercial reasons' which was very inconvenient and cost me lots of extra money in terms of hotel and other related travel expenses which I can't get back. My advice would be to steer well clear. A nightmare of a company - you don't know whether you're going to get where you've booked with them (or get back).,7/1/2012,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,1
A Arriens,1,AMS-IST: I was on the wing. This section has to do with 1 less FA than in the back. My warm meal arrived cold. KIX-IST: Like on the outbound flight a sense of disorganization during 1st meal service. One FA was running back and forth. Good on-time performance.,2/20/2014,3,3,3,3,2,5
A Bocci,0,We will not fly with Frontier again. After having paid for tickets for our trip to Costa Rica months in advance we were informed at the gate that our flight was delayed but the check in agent said that we should still be able to make our connecting flight through Denver. So we check our bags ($50 for 2) and go through security. Upon arrival at the gate we were told that we would arrive in Denver at 11:55 p.m. which was the departure time for our connecting flight to Costa Rica. We asked if they would be able to hold the plan for 10 minutes so that we and the 3-4 other passengers who were in the same situation could make the flight. The gate agent said that she had called the staff in Denver and they refused to hold the flight as it would further increase delays. Frustrated we asked to be put on the next flight hoping we could leave the following day at the latest but she told us that the next flight with available seats was in 6 days. We asked to speak to her manager who essentially said that out options were to wait six days or that she could (reluctantly) refund us for the cost of our original flight and book a new flight through a different airline. We had to research flights on our own as they had no intentions of helping us secure seats on a new flight. We ended up paying an additional $400 to book last minute tickets on American Airlines waiting for her to process our refund and get our mailing address to send our checked baggage fee back to us via mail and then rushing to the next terminal to go through security again and catch our flight. Ultimately we paid more than we would have if we'd just booked through American months ago. Plus the lack of customer service or care regarding out situation was infuriating. We are waiting for our flight to Costa Rica as I type this and just praying that they successfully rerouted our bags. Overall a terrible first experience with this airline and we didn't even make it on the plane.,5/21/2014,1,0,0,4,1,1
A Arruti,0,Buenos Aires - Eze to Madrid. Bad experience on my last flight with Iberia. Very old A340 300 aircraft. No PTV. Seats uncomfortable.

A Arvin,0,FCO-ORD. ORD-CMH Flew an ancient plane with no IFE with one shared TV. Seats were uncomfortable. Food was better this time around although the service was bad. The crew missed out serving several rows multiple times on the flight although they kept the drinks coming very frequent. One of the crew members stopped the food service for close to 10 minutes to continue speaking to a passenger about her family.,8/28/2014,3,2,3,1,1,4
A Bower,1,MAN-EWR-MAN - ten years since I flew Continental and its not as good as I remember. Check in at Manchester was OK but a bit slow. 757 was comfortable and good seat pitch. IFE was good. Cabin crew average we were served Chicken or Beef on a 9am flight then cabin crew disappeared after drinks service. Also had to pay for alcoholic drinks which I thought was poor for long haul. Had to call cabin crew for water during flight. Seems they serve for an hour have five hours off then serve a snack 1hr before landing. Same on return leg. Food was average. No hot towels in the morning for overnight return leg Check in at EWR was quite efficient although no one spoke just directed to a check in machine and did everything else myself. Seems to be becoming a no frills airline but without the no frills price !,1/22/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,7
A Arvin,0,Prague to Rome Fiumicino (Terminal 2) 18 August 2014. Ground staff were extremely rude about their overhead baggage policy. Cabin crew was more bothered about gossiping rather than serving the passengers.,9/1/2014,3,2,2,NaN,1,2
A Bradley,0,I was informed via email that my flight had been changed from 4.20pm to 3.00pm which was fine but airport services were in fact terrible! Arriving at the counter at 1.15pm I asked the counter if there was a delay in our flight I was told that there was no such delay for our flight and that our boarding time was at 2.30pm. 2.30pm came and went and there was no announcement made regarding our flight. There was no one at the AirAsia departure lounge counter so I went to the check in counter and asked staff what our flight status was. I was then informed that there would be announcements. 3.00pm - no announcements. 3.49pm still no announcements. 4.17pm no announcement. 4.28pm an announcement that our flight will be delayed 1 hour. 5.35pm an announcement that the plane will not arrive until 6.05pm. 6.08pm arrival of the plane. 6.35pm boarding. 7.00pm on the flight I asked the flight attendant for my pre purchased comfort kit and was informed that they did not have any on the flight. As you can imagine after spending over 3hours waiting for the flight and being told that my comfort kit was not available I was mighty ticked. I know that there are circumstances that flight will be delayed and I understand that but the lack of communication given to customers was poor. I had heard such good things regarding AirAsia but after this and the cancelation of our Clark to Kalibo flight on the 14th of November 2013 I will be very hesitant and wary of using AirAsia again.,8/11/2014,1,3,1,1,1,1
A Arwin,0,Currently still waiting for the flight at Hong Kong Airport. 5 hours and still counting. Can't blame the airlines 100% since the delay is due to military exercise in China (according to the news I googled while waiting) but their service is poor. No ground staff. My flight was supposed to leave HK at 21.20 to Shanghai and now is already 2am and yet no confirmation on gate number or departure time.

A Brathole,1,The whole setup at Luton with a private security channel is very convenient and about as hassle free as an airport experience can be these days. The Luton lounge is decent enough at least on par with an average business class lounge but not nearly in the same league as the Virgin Clubhouse at Heathrow. The Newark lounge is just a partitioned area in the arrivals hall without its own bathrooms etc so left a little to be desired. Also the security at Newark is just the standard lane shared with other airlines. In flight experience was similarly a slightly mixed bag. The flight attendants were friendly but seemed rather inexperienced and the food service was not particularly impressive. But the seat provided a good level of personal comfort which is really what matters most on a long flight. It had a continuous range of adjustments from upright to various reclining angles to (almost) flat and was more than adequate for getting some good sleep. I preferred this to the more plush Virgin Upper seats where the lie-flat design offers no positions between a limited initial reclining range and being turned fully flat. Overall the airline left you with the feeling that they are not quite as slick and professional as they would like you to think as some aspects of the end to end service package seemed a little half baked and improvised. But the positives easily outweighed the minor shortcomings and the bottom line is a great value for the money.,12/20/2007,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Athanasiadis,1,They offer good service and good prices. I travelled last year from Panama City to Los Angeles in business cabin and everything was perfect.

A Attwood,0,I recently travelled with my husband on Air Canada Rouge and was not pleased by the experience. My husband is 6'2 and his knees hit the seat in front of him and that was before the lady in front reclined! She should be allowed to recline as that's the type of seats that the airline claims to be selling but it shouldn't have been at the price of the person sitting behind her. If you didn't recline seats were very rigid and uncomfortable. Staff were ok but that was the only decent thing about the flight. Unfortunately this airline apparently tries to save weight by choosing not to stock their food and drink selection so the flight attendants weren't actually able to meet most peoples request. People were very frustrated by the cramped space limited food and overall crummy flight and some took it out on the flight attendants. This airline obviously cares as little about their employees as their customers since they choose to put their flight attendants in these situations. We called ahead of time to try and switch airlines since we originally booked with Air Canada's regular airline and wanted what we had initially booked. The lady on the phone assured us that the reviews on here were false and the Rouge service was the same as their regular service. Absolutely not true and I do not intend to fly with Air Canada Rouge ever again if I can help it.,10/28/2014,2,1,2,2,3,1

People had said that due to previous reports about Ryanair, stopped them from flying with the company.  We found these comments untrue, and will certainly use Ryanair again.

A Austin,1,PHL-LAX-PHL September 3-9. I went out to Los Angeles for a vacation on US Airways. When I arrived at Philadelphia airport to my surprise the check-in and TSA lines were not crowded at all for it being a Hub. As for the flight it was uneventful. It left on time and arrived to LAX few minutes early. Flight was smooth but trying to sleep and relax in those coach seats was uncomfortable. The flight coming back left on time as well and flight went smoothly. Since US Airways is about to be the only airline to be non-stop to between Philly and Los Angeles once Virgin America stops its flights in October looks I'll have no choice but to use US Airways as I personally hate connecting flights.,9/19/2014,4,2,3,1,3,5
A Brown,0,"I found four things seriously wrong with Qantas First Class. 1) The ""Chauffeur Drive"" service. Arriving in Sydney at 6.30am having booked a car I was surprised to be told (after finally locating the tiny unmarked desk) that there was a 15-20 minute wait until a car was available. Why? How? A car was booked. It should have been there end of story. Also in the car before my the previous flight (Sydney-London) I was delighted to receive an expletive-laden tirade across the driver's radio - apparently from one of his colleagues having a bad day. That is not ""first class"". 2) Baggage. Qantas advertises that First Class bags will be ""among the first"" to be delivered off the plane. On arrival in Sydney mine were among the last (both turning up on the carousel a full 50 minutes after landing; I do not remember the timing in London). 3) The breakfast. Scrambled eggs were dry. Avocado was unripe. Pancakes were also dry and overcooked. Coffee was weak and burnt. That is all. 4) The champagne. Qantas advertises three varieties. On every leg of the Sydney-London return trip the only one available was the Taittinger blanc de blancs. Methinks these are phantoms included in the wine list solely for appearances.",10/1/2014,1,4,1,4,3,1
A Avram,0,It seems like some things never change since I ended up spending the night in the Philly airport last night. Came in from Punta Cana on a US Airways flight which was delayed getting to Punta Cana. Our flight ended up leaving over an hour late from Punta Cana even though we were told it would only be a half hour delayed. Once arrived in Philly we ran to the gate from security and ended up missing the flight to Tampa. The plane was still at the gate but we were told it was too late. We went to customer service where they did nothing but give me a boarding pass for a flight at 8am the next morning. They claimed it wasn't the airlines fault we missed our connection since our original US Airways flight was delayed. Had to sleep in the Philly airport. US Airways you disappointed me yet again.,8/19/2013,1,2,3,0,1,NaN

Staff are always pleasant enough and a bit more professional than on most Middle Eastern carriers. The food was reasonable for airline food but definitely nothing special. The price was also quite good. KLM is an old solid European airline. Reliable even if a bit spartan. Would certainly use again if the price is right.,5/6/2014,4,4,3,1,4,8
A Brown,1,LCY-ORY-LCY. Very quick and easy on the way out from London attentive crew and plenty of croissants! Slight delay on return but time was made up and crew managed to come round twice with drinks on such a short flight.

A Aweidah,1,AMM-DOH-AMM in economy both ways on 777 ER 300. Plane in excellent condition very clean and seats extremely comfortable with plenty of leg room for a big guy like me (I am 6 ft 2). Inflight entertainment excellent with plenty of choice. The only real let down is the food which was terrible both ways and overwhelmed staff who did the bare minimum. The buses to the plane in Doha are a nightmare and it took over an hour to board the full 777 which resulted in a minor delay. The new Hamad airport should solve this pretty soon. The price was cheap I would definitely use them again in economy especially in long haul since the comfort they offer beats out Emirates or Etihad any day. European carriers business class is worse than QR economy.,3/31/2014,4,5,1,5,2,7
A Brutsch,0,We travelled on an organized tour from Vancouver to Guangzhou and on to Saigon. The tour had an all inclusive price hence we don't know how much the actual airfare would have been. The incoming flight into Vancouver was 2 hours delayed which resulted in a 3 hours late departure to Guangzhou. We had a stopover of 5 hours in Guangzhou before our flight to Saigon. However with the 3 hour delayed departure ex Vancouver the stopover was cut to 2 hours. As it turned out it was a blessing in disguise since one cup of Coffee at the Guangzhou Airport was an astonishing US $13. As to our flight we can only say never ever again will we be flying China Southern. Asking for red wine with our meal we were given the equivalent of a thimble full when asking for a refill we were told that no more wine was available. The crew were outright rude. The food was edible but that's about it. As I said never ever again will we be traveling on China Southern.,11/7/2013,0,3,3,0,1,2
A Aweidah,1,TLV-AMM-DXB and back and I have to say that RJ have come very far. Great clean planes with comfy seats on a combination of A321 and A330. Great entertainment system with many option and excellent sound quality. Pleasant staff especially in the air. The price was actually very competitive but I did book early. All connections were on time and my luggage arrived quickly. Transfer at the new airport in Amman was very smooth even on return with a very short connection. The new terminal definitely adds to the overall RJ experience. This airline deserves to be upgraded to 4 star and I am sure it will happen pretty soon.,10/20/2013,5,4,3,5,4,10
A Bulosan,1,Flew with them March 6th 2015 (BKK-MNL). Service was great food was excellent. What made this trip excellent are the FA's who have an eye for detail and anticipate passenger needs. MNL-BKK was quite delayed but we arrived on time in Bangkok. The food is not that good compared from the BKK-MNL flight. I noticed also that they didn't serve drinks before landing at Bangkok whereas my Bangkok to Manila flight FA's served us drinks. As an OFW (Overseas Filipino Worker) leaving the country means leaving your family and loved ones and it's a difficult thing for most of us and it did happen to me. I felt so homesick that I cried during take off and one FA noticed this and when we reached cruising altitude this FA came and asked me if I'm okay and I told her everything was fine. To my surprise she came back and gave me a glass of juice.,4/4/2015,5,5,5,4,5,10
A Aziz,0,Travelled on LHE-DOH-MAN flight in economy class. LHE-DOH was with 777-ER and had comfortable seats but DOH-MAN was A330 an old model with really congested seats. Not only this but inflight crew were not helpful. Food quality is just enough but most of all I found Doha airport really dis-satisfactory. The transit terminal and arrivals are served with buses and that makes transit very painful especially if travelling with kids. I am not impressed with Qatar Airways.,12/5/2013,3,2,3,2,3,6
A Burgio,1,FCO to LHR return. All flights on time cabin crew professional and polite food ok but no inflight entertainment system available (doesn't matter on a 2 hours flight). Will definitely fly them again.,4/28/2013,5,4,5,0,4,8
A B Mannes,0,Because I travel professionally from PHL I am stuck with US Airways as they have a monopoly on most domestic non- stops from here. This week alone on three separate flights customer service: 1) Refused to seat me with my wife on the same reservation as I was placed in a choice seat (ADA accommodation) and she would've had to pay $89 each way for the upgrade (one row up) or sit separately. Yes this was after I informed then it was due to an old line-of-duty injury they didn't care. 2) Refused to waive a $450 difference for a flight two hours before the flight I was booked on even though the requested change is because of an impending snow storm starting when the flight I'm booked on is leaving. 3) Charged bag fees to Cancun Mexico even though it is an international flight and they don't charge fees for every other Mexican city they fly to.,1/21/2015,0,0,0,0,0,NaN
A Butcher,1,"We flew back from Dalaman to Manchester on the 22.20 flight. I had seat 22A which meant a window seat for me. My wife had 22B. The seat was fine and the legroom adequate. I am 5'8"" tall and 160lbs. The wife is 4'10"" and 116lbs. I could stretch my legs out under the seat in front and I slept for 2 hours unaided by alcohol as I was driving at the other end. I didn't recline the seat. Taller and wider people have an advantage in life generally as they tend to look down on smaller people. So the 4 hour flight was a good experience for us. The flight crew were courteous and we would fly with Monarch again. Taller people who are generally more advantaged should pay for extra legroom or drive or sail.",10/1/2014,4,3,3,0,5,7
A B Mowla,1,Check-in at DAC was a breeze. Very polite ground staff at DAC and BKK. Flights left on time. Attentive FAs. Meals served were warm and good to taste. Nothing to complain about. Had flown with both TG and PG on these routes. Trust me Biman's service's as good as theirs.,7/6/2015,5,4,5,3,5,10
A Butler,1,"Singapore Airlines is a wonderful long-haul airline to fly. The legroom and footrest are great, the food was excellent and the menu was very nice. The service and the entertainment was excellent. Music, movies, shows and games on the screen. Yet there is a smaller selection than on many other airlines.",7/15/2015,5,4,4,4,5,9
A Bailey,0,CWL-NCL easy check in lounge very good took a couple of minutes from lounge to seat on aircraft. One cabin attendant fantastic service including complimentary drinks snacks sweets and hot towels on a 1 hour flight on 29 seater aircraft. Baggage reclaim at NCL took just a couple of minutes.,7/15/2008,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,5
A Byrne,1,Travelled in Premium Economy on the Dreamliner on 15th May 2014 from Manchester to Puerto Vallarta Angel of the Skies on the way out and Alfie on the return. We were lucky enough to get seats 1G+J on both legs of the journey so had lots of legroom. The seat was comfortable as long as you only wanted to sit and relax but it was extremely uncomfortable for sleeping. The footrest is a complete waste of time and quite dangerous as it doesn't go up high enough and therefore pressure is on the lower leg which can't be good when you're flying for 11+ hours. The armrests were very shabby and quite loose the TV unit was also wobbly and dirty although it did work well and was responsive. Considering the plane is not very old it's starting to look quite worn and untidy it wasn't very clean on either journey. The crew on the outward journey were a bit miserable and not very forthcoming with drinks the return crew were much better although there was very little choice of drinks left and even less items to purchase onboard. Obviously we had no problems getting out of the seats in Row 1 and we couldn't guarantee getting those seats each time so unless the seats are changed I don't think I'd waste my money travelling in premium again in the future. It could be so good with just a few tweaks here and there overall ok but a little disappointed. The positive aspects were reduced jet lag very quiet and a great sense of space due to the height of the cabin.,7/13/2014,3,2,3,4,3,5
A Bailey,0,"Pensacola to San Francisco. After paying full fare for a toddler in a seat my pregnant daughter was treated so inconsiderately by American Airlines staff that none of us will ever fly with this airline again. No pre-board because ""there are too many children on this flight"" and they took her stroller away so that she had to carry 2 bags and the child. On one leg of the flight they gave her back the stroller last and nearly made her miss her connection. There is no compassion from this airline!",7/8/2014,1,1,1,1,1,1
A Cai,1,TT253 MEL-SYD and back last week. Very lucky to be able fly at this price. Although not as non-bumpy as Qantas flights the servicing was decent. Discomfort was caused (usually anyway) by other passengers - in that case talking loudly. On the way back it was reclining when it's only a domestic flight! Special mention this time I flew: I left my headphones on the plane calls to the Tigerair service center were promptly answered. The address to the lost property office provided was correct and they responded even at midnight! Very polite and kind. Got my headphones back the next day. The T4 improvements - so much better than last year- not bad to travel on them from Melbourne now.,9/14/2014,4,4,0,0,5,9
A Baker,1,Lots of negativity read before I flew Newark return. Not really worried as I'm not a fussy person. Flight out was on time attendants were courteous and professional food was OK for airline food. Return was supposed to land and 07:30 so booked train tickets accordingly then changed to land at 09:05 so changed train accordingly but landed at 07:45. Not many will moan about landing early but cost me train change costs for 3 people. Having said that everything on the return (apart from changing our seats and splitting 1 of our family up - not the end of the world) was good. Food (beef stew) again OK and hit the spot. Would I fly Virgin again. Definitely. If you can see past the fact that a few hours flight on an aeroplane is not supposed to be a fortnight in a five star hotel then Virgin will do the job just fine.,11/6/2014,4,4,4,5,5,9
A Caltabiano,1,ATH to FRA. Nice clean A320 polite and smiling crew. Service consisted of nice hot dish (unusual these days for short haul) and dessert Just one round of drinks (wine and beers available free of charge) but those who asked were served a second one with a smile. Crew perhaps a bit too tolerant with passengers who did not respect the seat belt sign during taxiing. .,6/20/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
A Bakshi,1,Wonderful trip from Toronto to Brussels Brussels to Delhi. For economy the food was great and tasty. They provided chicken filled pastries which were nice in between the main meals and lots to drink. Beer whiskey coke. The crew was very nice and generous. Tickets are a bit pricey at times but it's worth it. The newer A330-300's are very nice and are new/modern. Will fly with them again!,3/23/2015,4,4,5,4,5,10
A Cambra,1,Birmingham-Alicante 9/6/2013 return 15/6/2013. Good old Monarch is back! Flights on time clean aircraft and very friendly crew.,6/16/2013,4,4,0,0,5,10
A Bakulin,0,Had to pay for luggage although was not informed by my agent about this extra cost (almost everyone in the check in queue had a similar unpleasant surprise feeling). Seats were old with a large pitch. Charging people for drinks on-board made the service slow and annoying. Tickets were pricey. Will never fly with them again.,8/16/2012,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,2
A Cameron,1,BA 870 22nd Dec 2014. Flew from London to Budapest. Very satisfied with service staff friendly and professional. Even though this was a fairly short trip food and beverages were very satisfactory. Will definitely recommend this airline.,1/19/2015,5,5,4,4,5,10
A Balmer,0,Just returned from holiday to Thailand flying out from London to KL and on to Krabi. First time with MA. Both flights were late but that was the least of the problems! We arrived in Krabi on Saturday 28th Feb - our luggage arrived late on Sunday 1st Mar. Several other passengers on the flight and the following flight that afternoon suffered the same problem. Coming home we flew from Koh Samui to KL and then on to London - again both flights were delayed. This time however there was a 50% improvement they managed to deliver us and 1 of our 2 cases at the same time and in the same place - well done MA! Again there were around 20 other passengers who had delayed baggage. Seriously what kind of an outfit manages to mislay a passenger's cases twice on the same trip? Absolute shower. I shall never fly with this airline again.,3/20/2015,2,2,3,3,4,1
A Cameron,1,Singapore - Helsinki. Very impressed with Finnair. Staff friendly and professional. Good amounts of tasty food good variety of drinks seats very comfortable and clean cabin. The flight overall was pleasant I enjoyed the movie I was watching and announcements were very clear in English and Finnish. I highly recommend this airline.,1/19/2015,4,4,5,4,5,10
A Barnes,1,LHR-SIN-PEN return. Flight from Heathrow to Singapore was the usual experience. Staff very helpful and friendly food good for airline food. Inflight entertainment is very good lots of choice. Good snacks available between meals. The A380 we flew on was looking a little tired a few marks and scratches on the seats. Flight from Singapore to Penang was with silk air. First time with them and very happy with the service.,5/1/2015,5,3,4,5,5,9
A Cameron,1,AKL-SCL SCL-AKL. Both flights satisfactory. I found the service very good the cabin crew were polite and professional. Food was plentiful and good. Offered drinks in between meals mainly water. The interior was lovely and clean they supplied everyone with a blanket pillow and headphones IFE very good plenty to keep you entertained. Leg room was decent. Thoroughly enjoyed both trips and will be flying LAN in the future.,1/2/2013,3,4,4,4,5,10
A Barnes,0,Traveling Air Canada was the worst experience I have had. The agents were extremely rude and unhelpful in Toronto Pearson airport. Common courtesy seemed to have been an understatement. Flights were cancelled without proper notification leaving passengers stranded in the airport with no where to comfortably stay. Not sure if this is policy but agents were not required to assist with bag tagging leaving first time fliers lost and confused.,2/24/2015,1,1,1,1,1,1
A Barnett,1,Flew from Dusseldorf to JFK. A330 service in Business class. I often fly BA Virgin and Singapore Airlines transatlantic. I have to say I thought Air Berlin were just as good (admittedly SIA use A380's on the JFK- Frankfurt run and are a little roomier). I thought the seat was very good (I was in 2A). The food was good and the entertainment system was good although I think Virgin wins that one. Flight was on time despite a big headwind. I will definitely fly them again and love the fact I can avoid Heathrow and use my Avios points.,10/8/2014,5,5,4,4,5,9
A Campbell,0,My new husband and I decided to take the 5hr flight to Scotland (Honeymoon vacation) because it was the cheapest by far. We had done several 5hr flights before and thought we would be fine. I have never seen a people that so openly made it apparent they hate Americans. It started after the flight took off and I asked the attendant for a drink of water. She sneered at me nodded and I never got the drink. When the food car came by she went past us. At first I thought it was just us but then I noticed they ignored three other American couples. Halfway through the flight two small children started playing in the isle. I thought they would stop it but no. And when i asked them to make it stop because the children were kicking peoples seats the attendant just gave me this bored look and said something to the children in Icelandic. Sure the seats were really small and cramped and the food and entertainment were ok but that is to be expected.,5/5/2013,1,1,5,3,1,NaN
A Carballude,1,"JFK-MAD-SCQ. I normally fly every summer to Spain with Iberia. Normally my experience is awful but last summer it was excellent. Unlike Iberia's Airbus A340-300/600 there were TVs at every seat. We had a choice of movies and TV shows. At check-in I was offered an upgrade to fly Business Class for 70 US dollars (great deal) I refused because I thought it wasn't going to be anything special. The first thing I'm going to suggest to everybody If you're taller than 6'1"" I would recommend you pay 70 dollars for the upgrade. I'm 6'3"" and there wasn't much leg room for me especially when the person in front of me puts their seat in a reclining position. The flight attendants were much nicer and show that they care unlike my previous experiences. Now I completely recommend Iberia they have improved a lot.",1/25/2014,4,3,5,5,4,10
A Barros,0,"Flight JJ8020 from Rio de Janeiro to Santiago. To call it a business class is a gross exaggeration. To begin with, with a flight departure at 07.04am, the lounge was not open until 06.15 when they began boarding for the flight. On board, no welcome drink, a broken seat (luckily the seat next to mine was available, so I could move) and a cabin crew that were more interested to talk to each other than to welcome boarding passengers. After take-off, again the cabin crew spent most of their time closing the curtain between the business class and the galley. Breakfast was reasonable and had a choice of a platter of cold cuts and a hot omelette. After that, no more spontaneous drink service for a 4.5 hour flight. Selection of the press very poor and no individual entertainment system. The aircraft was old and looked and felt old. Very indifferent service.",7/14/2015,1,1,3,1,1,2
A Caro,0,Feb 15 2014 I flew from ORD to LAX. The flight was the first one of the day. After 5 hours delay we boarded the plane and were told that a credit of $100 was going to be issued to us for a future reservation. I never received anything. I called Spirit and asked for the voucher number. Now the amount is $50! The customer service told me to call the airport and complain to them because the airport is responsible for issuing those vouchers. The customer service is terrible. Never again unless I really have no choice I rather spend more money than use Spirit again.,3/4/2014,2,1,1,1,1,1
A Bartlett,1,I flew with Royal Brunei because the were offering an unbelievably cheap return to Melbourne from Heathrow at the time I wanted to fly. For approx Â£750. I knew what I was expecting so wasn't upset that there was no onboard alcohol sales. Relatively comfortable with a good selection of IFE although the unit I had on the leg from Brunei to Melbourne was faulty and required multiple restarts to get it working. The food was surprisingly nice but the drinks service was a little lax and frugal my request for a drink took 30 minutes before receiving the same amount again. The frequent stops helped break up the flight and were a welcome hiatus from the cabin where the air could get quite stale. Overall I'd recommend and fly again with Royal Brunei especially if I'm on a budget but would consider spending extra if it meant getting that bit extra that comes as standard with other airlines that fly this route.,10/25/2013,5,4,5,4,3,7
A Casamax,1,LH411 from JFK to Munich 23 August 2014. I sat in Business class together with my family. The comfort was satisfactory for the space the seats and the service. Staff was very friendly and professional food and drinks were of good quality. Overall I appreciated the service and quality of this airline. I am frequent traveler and I always prefer to travel with Lufthansa both in economy and business so I recommend it to everyone.,9/1/2014,4,5,4,5,4,9
A Barton,1,Manchester - Stockholm and return. Great value for money modern aircraft friendly service. Could you need anything else on short haul flights - I don't think so. Flights on time Wi-Fi onboard too so time passed quickly easy check in at both airports. Far superior than other low-cost airlines. Definitely recommend this airline and will definitely use them again. Not sure what the long-haul service would be like but great for short hops across Europe.,9/8/2013,5,5,0,5,5,10
A Cecchi,0,I am of Italian background and live in Scotland. I decided to take my elderly mother-in-law to Italy for a holiday. We had an efficient and friendly flight with BA from Edinburgh to Heathrow where we connected to Alitalia. The contrast between the friendly BA staff and the rather surly and unhelpful Alitalia staff was shocking. While our flight to Italy took off with a minimal delay the service was minimal with only a snack served and a murky tea. We had to transfer in Milan for a flight to Naples and pass through chaotic 'security'. I was not impressed at all with the internal Alitalia flight as the staff seemed only interested in exchanging gossip over passengers. My mother-in-law requested a glass of water and was ignored. Certain so-called no frills airlines offer a much better service than Alitalia. I felt ashamed that the flag carrier of Italy could not do better.,4/19/2015,2,3,1,0,1,4
A Basile,0,Scheduled to fly Frontier 902 ATL to TTN today. Flight canceled without notification or explanation. Next flight offering to TTN was in 5 days! Frontier refused to assist with rebooking on an alternate airline. Offered only refund or hotel voucher. Customer service offered no other assistance. I was left on my own to book same day out of ATL on Memorial holiday (to PHL requiring trains and cab to reach my car at TTN airport). Very expensive out-of-pocket.,5/26/2014,1,0,0,0,1,NaN
A Chaffin,0,When we arrived at the airport all of the other airlines had fairly short check-in queues American Airlines filled up their queue and had a line going 30 yards down the hallway. It seemed that their computers must have shut down because the line wasn't moving. It took us two hours to get checked-in and check our bags. We would have been late for our flight but it was delayed anyway. The delay was over an hour and once we did get on the flight the seats were the most uncomfortable I have ever experienced. Our delayed flight caused us to only have 30 minutes to catch our connecting flight- which ended up leaving 10 minutes early (I am not making this up)- meaning we missed it. They issued us tickets for the next flight 3 hours later. We had confirmed seats on the ticket and everything but when we went to board the plane our tickets got flagged as invalid and we were told by the attendant that we were actually in standby- the plane ended up being full and we were not allowed on. So at this point my wife (7 months pregnant) is about to lose it and they tell us we can possibly fly out at 9 PM that evening. We do make that flight and arrive at our destination at midnight missing our evening plans and exhausting us. Again the flight itself was awful. I had taken 4 advil at this point and still had back pain. Never again American Airlines never again.,5/18/2014,1,1,2,1,2,1
A Bass,1,We flew to Rome Fiumicino from Leeds-Bradford on the 11th April 2013. The flight was brilliant. It was on-time the cabin crew were friendly and the seats were well cushioned.,7/14/2013,5,5,5,NaN,5,10
A Bastien,0,5/0/15 PHL-SLC Airbus A320. Flight similar to the ones I took on 5/4/15. Economy comfort is better than economy but not by much. Its main advantage is priority boarding which allows me to avoid the inevitable rush and scramble for overhead bin space. Rated food as 1 because I didn't buy any entertainment also as 1 because there wasn't any. I don't look forward to flying with Delta even in economy comfort.,5/20/2015,1,3,3,1,3,6
A Chan,0,Flights between Portland and Anaheim were a huge disappointment in terms of flight delays. We saw the airplane arrive but our flight kept being delayed without giving us a reason. We understand that there are some issues going on but as customers we would like to be recognized for our waiting at the airport. The good sides: The flight seats were okay. The drinks and snacks were pretty nice. But I have had better experiences on other flights.,7/7/2013,3,4,4,3,4,6
A Bastien,0,5/4/15 SMF-MSP Airbus A320 Economy Comfort legroom adequate service competent. Complaint: Delta does not post economy comfort fares on its website but as separate upgrades for each flight segment. Value for money rated at 1 because I traveled on an award ticket entertainment rated as 1 because the flight didn't have any. Legroom was slightly better than on previous Economy Comfort flights but recline was still minimal. Food for purchase was unappealing but the complimentary snacks and beverages were acceptable. I wouldn't recommend Delta because it seems to focus more on nickel and diming its passengers than in providing quality service.,5/20/2015,1,3,3,1,3,6
A Chan-Tidemann,0,"When attempting to travel to Cape Town from New York City for Cape Town Jazz Festival flight got cancelled due to engine failure. Took 3.5 hrs to get rebooked onto an Emirates Flight departing 12 hrs later which would have 8 hr layover in Dubai. Got day rooms at JFK after some discussion. When returning to airport to check into Emirates flight we were told SAA had never made the reservation in the system there would be no meals and there was no connection out of Dubai. We went home. As compensation they ""offered"" us 25% off a new ticket.",5/14/2013,1,3,0,0,3,NaN
A Bastien,0,OKC to ATL then ATL to TPA MD 80 from OKC to ATL then twin engined wide body Boeing from ATL to TPA. Seats on both flights were uncomfortable with minimal recline. The headrest pushes my head forward making it difficult for me to nap. On both flights I forgot to bring my seat to the upright position for landing. The FAs didn't notice or might have figured it didn't make any difference. I would not pay to fly Delta in economy or EC on account of the uncomfortable seats. I traveled on a free ticket purchased by my spouse with FF miles so I gave Delta three stars for Value for Money. Food for purchase but items that appealed to me weren't available. The FAs were courteous the flight uneventful. However Delta is my least-favorite airline.,1/5/2015,3,1,1,1,4,5
A Charlesworth,0,BGI to KIN. Flight had started in POS and arrived in BGI 10 mins late. There was some confusion as to seat assignments on boarding as people from POS had moved. But the two very pleasant crew members at the rear of the cabin that met us at the door were on hand to make sure everyone was in the seats that had been assigned. Because of the routing of the aircraft you do get the feel that it is a glorified bus service with nothing being served between BGI and SXM. However although the crew passed through with no service as such they were happy to get you canned drinks tea coffee and other such items. We landed in SXM (stunning views and landing) and had about 50 mins on the ground to pick up passengers before we continued on to KIN. We took off on the 2 hour 15 min flight and a full meal service was conducted with a choice of 2 entrees. Alcohol is available for a charge of $5 but all other drinks are free. The only down side is the very frustrating drop down screens that play the company promo video over the loud speaker. You really cant get away from it unless you have your head sets ready to play some music to drown it out. But be aware they only let you check in one item of baggage for the hold. even if you have a really big bag they let you take it in the cabin as there is as charge of around $25 US to check in a second bag.,2/13/2009,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,3
A Bastien,0,October 17th 2014. Traverse City Michigan (TVC) to DTW DTW-LAX LAX-SMF. TVC-DTW and LAX-SMF on Delta Connection. DTW-LAX on Delta. The FAs on the connection flights were courteous and competent. On Delta after the beverage cart had gone by I asked a passing FA for a second glass of wine. She refused to bring it told me I'd have to wait until the beverage cart returned which was over an hour later. The Economy Comfort seats on Delta were not much better than economy - slightly more legroom but the recline seemed the same. I was unable to sleep because the headrest pushed my head forward. The Economy Comfort seats on the Connection flights felt more comfortable. Delta provided a wide array of entertainment choices. I only fly Delta because my spouse buys my tickets with her frequent flyer miles. I would not recommend Delta for long haul flights on account of the uncomfortable seats. Next time my spouse and I fly to Europe or Asia I will ask her to use her FF miles for flights on a Delta partner with better seats.,10/28/2014,2,1,3,5,2,3
A Chauhan,1,QF172 - Wellington to Melbourne on 21 April 2014. After the negative press that Qantas has been receiving recently I felt it necessary to comment at how exceptional this flight was. I was a little hesitant initially given that the aircraft (B737-800) was a narrow aisle aircraft and was operated by Jetconnect crew. How wrong I was! The plane itself had a variety of IFE options. The staff were brilliant warm perceptive and on top of every passenger's needs. The only critique would be the food options - unfortunately the Cajun fish I had was a little bland. I was happy to receive a great beverage service something lacking from many airlines. Keep up the excellent work Qantas.,4/23/2014,5,5,4,5,5,9
A Bastien,0,10-12-14 SEA-DTW-TVC. SEA-DTW on Delta DTW-TVC on Delta Connection. The blue vinyl seats on Delta were very uncomfortable had minimal legroom and recline the plastic armrests hurt my arms after an hour or so. I was unable to sleep because the headrest pushed my head forward. Seats on Delta Connection were more comfortable. My one star rating is for the Delta seats. I didn't use the inflight entertainment system which appeared to have a good selection. I would not recommend Delta for long haul flights. My spouse purchased my ticket with her frequent flyer miles. Next month when we fly from California to Florida I'll ask her to book our flight on a Delta partner if possible. The Delta seats are too uncomfortable for long haul flights. Same goes for our upcoming trips to Europe and Thailand next year.,10/28/2014,2,1,2,5,3,3
A Chick,1,AA79 30th Dec. AA50 8th Jan. I flew AA to PHX from LHR via DFW. Had a 772 on the way out and a 77W on the way back the internal flights were on an MD80. On all flights the service was excellent and on AA50 was quite outstanding. I was expecting very average flights but was hugely impressed with all aspects from start to finish. I would avoid row 1 on the 77W because on light invasion from the galley.,1/20/2014,5,4,4,4,5,10
A Chinnery,1,Stansted to La Rochelle. Got to airport around 3 hours before departure and as we had no baggage we went through security. Security took 27 mins. Unacceptable. Then we waited for around for 90 mins before flight was called and we went to gate 44 immediately. As being called 40 mins before and getting to gate 35 mins before we thought the plane would be there in 10 mins. It wasn't and was there no earlier than 25 mins of waiting at the gate. We were rushed on to the steps to Tarmac whist pax where deboarding and we where on it around 3 mins before our scheduled departure time. We where off 15 mins behind schedule. The flight was smooth and fine. I had a Pepsi and just looked out of the window no IFE or food. We sat in row 5 and had priority boarding. The aircraft landed 10 mins early and we had the usual fanfare. We where de boarded quickly and went straight through to meet relatives who have a 2nd home and took our bags with them. La Rochelle to Stansted. We got there 2 hours 15 mins before flight and we went through security. Relatives driving back took bags with them. There is 1 duty free shop and a cafe. There where 2 aircraft departing at same time and being the first in the lounge gets us a seat. (La Rochelle gets overcrowded). The aircraft got in 10 mins early but the other Brussels flight was late. Boarding began 10 mins before departure and we where off just after the Brussels 15 mins behind. The flight was ok. My seat was dirty and had gum under the seat in front. Again row 5 and priority boarding. We landed 2 mins behind and Ryanair were not sneaky and didn't do the fanfare we were out of Stansted in 25 mins.,7/31/2014,4,2,1,NaN,2,7
A Bastien,0,Early August flight from SMF - MSP - YYZ (Sacramento - Minneapolis - Toronto). I flew economy comfort on an early flight from SMF to MSP The MSP to YYZ flight was on Endeavor Air / Delta Connection. The economy comfort seats had adequate legroom but almost no recline making it impossible for me to nap (the seat backs had a tilt-your- head-forward built-in headrest). The seats on Endeavour had minimal legroom but more recline and I was able to nap during the two-hour flight to Toronto. The plastic armrests on the SMF-MSP flight were extremely uncomfortable. Economy comfort wasn't worth the money. One star for food and entertainment (I didn't buy food for purchase no entertainment on either flight). My wife has Delta Platinum FF status. Next month we fly to Michigan Amsterdam France and Israel. I'll let her exchange FF miles for my tickets as long as we avoid Delta and fly internationally on a code share airline such as KLM. The FAs on both flights were competent courteous and seemed to care about their passengers. I wish Delta management had the same attitude.,9/6/2014,1,1,1,1,5,3
A Bastien,1,LAX to SMF on 12-10-14. Small regional jet economy but in an exit row with more than adequate legroom. Uneventful flight decent airline would fly Skywest again.,1/5/2015,3,3,1,1,4,7
A Chinnery,0,WW206 LGW-KEF. From our first flight; I gather that Wow air is a semi decent low cost airline that requires improvement. Check in opened 3hours and 30 mins before and a new hand luggage allowance has been out in place meaning passengers where getting nervous if the there bags would be fine. Wow air fail to provide online check in making it less of an attractive option. On today's flight wow air where 20mins late arriving and boarding was chaotic. They boarded in rows but nobody listened. We took off 35 mins late and the inflight experience was the same as easyjet. We saw the northern lights which was a plus but doesn't affect the airline's performance. The flight landed 20mins late in a blizzard but the pilot did a good job and landed smoothly. The crew where chatty but professional. Once arriving in KEF the jetway failed to attach on several attempts and we waited for 30mins before we could get off. Even worse we had to wait for another 30mins for our luggage meaning we left KEF at 00.25 instead of 23.30 not good. WOW AIR need improvement to its ground services before I can recommend it. However our return expirence may be better if not in a blizzard. The inflight was average for low cost travel.,2/24/2015,3,3,3,3,3,5
A Batchelor,1,Burbank-Phoenix SWA286. Phoenix-Buffalo SWA197. July 17th. My first time flying Southwest and I was very impressed. Customer Service was the best I have seen and I have been on United Delta American etc. I was flying from Burbank to Buffalo via Phoenix and the first flight was 15 minutes early and the 2nd flight was right on time! I read a lot of people on here do not like the seating policy I honestly love it it is very simple and you choose which seat you want and Southwest is known for being the quickest airline for planing and deplaning. Flight attendants were very nice I liked the humor they used for their announcements. You have complimentary non- alcoholic drinks and they give you a bag of peanuts and pretzels. All in all I would recommend Southwest.,7/27/2014,5,4,5,NaN,5,10
A Choitz,0,"I booked a ""direct"" flight from Berlin Germany to Newark NJ USA and instead of being direct once we got to the airport we were told the airplane would be stopping to fuel up in Maine (obviously not for our flight but for the one after ours). Furthermore having made this trip from Germany/USA several times with other various airlines in comparison United has old planes and less amenities. Lastly there was no way to request a special meal from their website I looked and looked but the meal option was continually grayed out and ended up having to call customer service - another inconvenience.",7/20/2014,2,2,1,2,4,4
A Bateman,0,Out 22 Nov back 24 Nov. Flight number 2436 outbound and back flight 2435. My wife and I went on a weekend trip to Krakow. When we were told to board the plane for the return flight we got out onto the concourse but the passengers on the incoming flight were still on it! We stood in pouring rain waiting. What a shambles. Never again.,11/28/2013,1,1,0,NaN,3,1
A Bates,0,I recently flew LHR-BKK return on Gulf Air. The flights were all on time which is always good. The seats are a little bit hard for my liking. The cabin crew are adequate nothing more nothing less. The IFE is not as good as many airlines. The food is very average also on the LHR-BAH and vice versa legs only one meal was served for a 6.5 hour flight and a 7.5 hour flight needless to say I was hungry. The BAH-BKK legs also only have one meal but you get a piece of cake about 50 mins before landing so not great. Only the way home I had a ten hour layover in Bahrain (overnight) I was not offered the option of a hotel or given any food coupons during this period to say this is poor is an understatement! The airline has declined since the last time I flew with them it now feels like a long haul budget airline which is a shame as they used to be outstanding!,3/4/2015,2,2,1,2,2,4
A Christner,1,I flew Turkish Airlines for the first time recently and was very impressed. I just flew shorter flights between Athens and Istanbul and Izmir and Istanbul but found the cabin crew to be professional and gracious and even on a one hour regional flight still received a meal of a whole grain roll with cheese green lettuce and tomato with some yoghurt as well. After flying United with its deathly pale iceberg lettuce and overcooked food on a long flight it was really refreshing! Maybe I was on the newer planes but they were so clean and with individual screens even on shorter flights. Great experience.,10/15/2013,5,4,4,4,4,10
A Christodoulou,1,BRU-WAW-LCA 5 January 2014. Web-check-in system very easy but as usual many front seats blocked in advance even if I always try to check in online as soon as web-check-in opens. This is a night flight from Brussels to Warsaw and then in Larnaca it arrives at 02.55am (+1). Flight from Brussels left with 20 mins delay but this was not a problem as there was enough layover time in Warsaw for my connection flight to Larnaca. Arriving in Warsaw and going to the gate there was already announced 15 mins delay in boarding. It seems that most of the people don't respect the hand baggage allowance rule and also the airline itself shows much tolerance on this. I could see many people (all in economy) boarding carrying 2-3 handbags and ground staff and flying attendants saying nothing about it. This gets annoying because besides onboard safety it is the space issue in the overhead cupboards not enough space for everybody. After boarding and being seated we had to wait in the aircraft for 50 mins. Pilot informed us after 30 mins we had to wait for baggage and that is why there was a delay. In any case flight left with almost an hour delay and arrived in Larnaca at 3.25 am instead of 2.55am. Service was average (as usual LOT doesn't offer onboard meals and you have to buy your food). Food is reasonably priced. Flight attendants polite but many not very friendly. I recommend this flight mainly because of the good connections and time schedule allowing you to not waste your day flying but instead flying in the evening.,1/17/2014,4,3,3,0,3,6
A Baum,1,LHR-KEF Economy. Very pleasant flight. Surprised to find IFE on a short European flight. Modern planes friendly crew excellent food available for purchase. A definite difference to the increasingly no-frills service provided by other European airlines.,1/14/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,10
A Chudleigh,0,Flew Malaysia Airlines 4 times in the last month. The flight departing Kuala Lumpur to Sydney at 22.50 provided no evening meal but a snack only. This turned out to be an inedible mushroom sausage roll. The alternative (non vegetarian) was not available. This is clearly inadequate for a 5 star airline particularly as we had been on a connecting flight with a 3 hour transit at KL and the breakfast serving would not be for 5 hours. Malaysia certainly need to lift their catering for long haul flights.,11/4/2013,3,3,2,4,3,7
A Beal,0,Booked to fly back from Florence to Gatwick on 19th April. Chaos at airport did not get on flight although checked in and luggage tagged. Told to take luggage with us and return later for more information. Did not get on flight so had to stay another night. One member of my group given back her boarding pass and got on flight but having checked in luggage there was none when she arrived at Gatwick and waited days for its return. Flight was very empty so why could we all not board? Very poor communication from staff and no reason given for delay. Will not travel again with them as it seems they often leave luggage behind.,5/2/2015,3,4,1,1,4,3
A Chung,1,ICN-SFO B777 Smartium Business - Seat is very similar to Alitalia's business class very comfortable lie-flat direct aisle access from every seat. What made this flight great however were the flight attendants. Not just one but the entire crew made you feel as if they really enjoy their job. Always had a genuine smile.Food and beverages were great except that my first breakfast choice was not available. Inflight entertainment not the best in the world but definitely not the worst. You have to experience the service to understand the world of difference between European US and Chinese carriers. Too bad they don't fly from the US to Europe otherwise I would be a regular.,1/23/2015,5,5,4,4,5,9
A Beatson,1,Flew JNB-DXB-LHR. Excellent service and amazing selection of the latest movies and TV series. Both aircraft's (777-300er and A380) were brand new and very comfortable. I have flown this route many times and will always look for a deal with Emirates before looking elsewhere as I know that I can expect the best.,1/24/2014,5,4,5,5,5,9
A Cianetti,0,FCO-DOH-BKK and vice versa. Finally a new hub but after I've traveled this month with LH AF and BA I had a lot of expectations. No meal menu on 3 of 4 flights. On the 6 hours night flight the second meal was served very early (more than 2 hours before the landing) so no one was able to rest.,6/23/2014,3,2,3,3,2,3
A Beck,0,"Do not fly this airline unless you have no other choice. If you're looking at price, consider that you may have up to $100 in additional fees each way when you're comparing to other airlines if you're checking a bag. Pay attention to the fine print and the even finer print when you're thinking about checking or carrying on bags. This is hands down the worst experience I have had on an airline, and I'm not half done with my trip yet. I am sitting in the airport delayed 4 hours for my first and last Spirit Airlines flight (except for the flight home, which I unfortunately have to endure). ",6/17/2015,1,1,1,NaN,1,1
A Cilia,1,Flew MEL-MCY return on JQ794 11th Jan and JQ793 18th Jan. JQ794 - 11th Jan 2014. Aircraft: A320 VH-VGT. Seat 20F. We had carry on only and we used web check in so we could go straight to the gate no queuing or anything. Flight was on time and aircraft was clean. Seat was adequately comfortable however the legroom was limited it would be a bit uncomfortable on a longer flight. Crew were especially good on this flight very welcoming and helpful. Didn't purchase any food onboard or entertainment onboard - no need to spend the extra $$ on a short flight. Arrived early. JQ793 - 18th Jan 2014. Aircraft A320 VH-VQQ. Seat: 28F. Flight was good seat pretty comfortable more legroom on this older and differently configured aircraft. Once again didn't purchase any food or entertainment. Crew were helpful. Arrived on time. Overall I was very pleased with the service. We just wanted the cheapest fare so we don't care about extras like luggage entertainment food. There was nothing to complain about - Jetstar excelled in every area and I would definitely fly with them again.,1/20/2014,5,4,0,0,5,9
A Beeby,1,BLK-FAO and BLK-AGP. Two return journeys out of Blackpool and the service and punctuality of the flights was good. Very friendly check in staff fuss free boarding presentable aircraft with reasonable legroom and most cabin crew friendly and proficient.,10/4/2012,4,3,3,NaN,4,8
A Clark,1,I found the planes great staff helpful and food good for the length of journey. We flew TAM-GRU recife return and Gru to Manaus and to Salvador then back to GRU. It is efficient and I will fly them again.,6/19/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
A Bel,1,Frequent flyer AMS-BEG: all the compliments for the staff - Air Serbia provides a great service and a really nice selection of complementary food & beverages. A couple of points for improvement: please add an evening flight on Thursday for AMS-BEG line add on-line check-in please return the 30kg baggage limit finally improve the check- in procedure in BEG for early flights.,8/26/2014,5,5,5,3,5,8
A Clark,1,Chicago to St. Louis round-trip. All flights were on time with friendly service. Midday in Chicago I cleared security in 10 minutes. Mobile boarding pass is very helpful. Boarding was quick and easy. Flight operated by Shuttle America E-170. The plane was very comfortable with lots of legroom in standard economy. I am 6' and had no problem. Return was equally as easy. St. Louis security very quick. This flight was operated by Trans State ERJ- 145. It was fine for the hour flight but anything longer would have been unpleasant. Narrow seats and aisle less legroom low ceiling seats falling apart very loud engines and lots of turbulence. Flight attendant very nice. Arrived 20 minutes early. The cost was definitely worth it over driving or amtrak given the punctuality. No inflight entertainment was offered on either flight which is fine for such short flights. I arrived an hour be fore both flights but could have got there much later. I recommend United and usually don't have issues with them and plan to fly them again in the future.,2/18/2015,4,4,3,1,4,7
A Beling,0,Definitely not for flying with small children. I flew to Poland with my nearly 3 months old daughter and got no help from staff whatsoever. I paid for seat for my little girl however was expected to keep her on my lap as she wasn't allowed to have her own. It would be great if I could just lay her down surely we would both be more comfortable. Also women with kids or pregnant get no priority at the boarding gates staff are rude and treated us as a load not a human beings talking down to us. At the end of the day we are paying customers so show us some respect! Will not fly with them again.,9/3/2012,1,2,3,NaN,1,1
A Clarke,0,SYD-LAX-SYD. Traveled on their 747 - the plane was in appalling condition. My wife was 5 months pregnant and her tray table had to be held up with a cushion TV did not work on any of our 3 seats (row 65 - but spoke to a lot of other people and their TV's did not work either) - food not fit for economy! Staff were pleasant enough but plane was falling apart cosmetically and because they retire the 747's in November no effort is made to make the journey more comfortable and no apology or compensation for putting up with such low standards. We requested to change to the newer planes hard enough to entertain a 3 year old for 17 hours but we booked as they said they had personal screens. Would help if they worked. I was very polite on the phone and asked if they could make this date change to travel on the Airbus a few days later and they said not without a high date change fee per person! Would never recommend them to anyone.,11/5/2013,2,1,1,1,3,NaN
A Belle,1,"We returned yesterday from Toronto to Panama. I was worried reading some reviews but the service and overall experience was excellent! First rate movies (free headphones) champagne food was good snacks smooth flight experience.

A Clarke,1,Flew from AGP-DUB on EI585 (A333) paid a bit extra to sit in Business class not sure how comfortable I'd be lying 'down' at that angle for a long period of time or if it's worth it. The entertainment screen can be pretty difficult to see if the shade is left up. EI should maybe roll out a business 'lite' for this route and throw free something or other into the mix but really it's quite a short flight so not hugely important but might be a nice touch. Bought a breakfast quite nice and filling. Crew the usual brand of EI pleasant. Usual happened on landing and has happened the last few times it's almost like someone has a peek out of a window and wonders what a plane is doing there as if it's a surprise. Waited an age to get on stand even though multiple were empty equally as long for a land bridge and then another 20 mins for luggage. Fine in the air but the ground needs work. Recommend all the same just don't be in a rush after landing.,6/9/2014,3,4,4,3,5,8
A Benghazi,0,May 14th AA63. May 21st AA62. Paris-Miami Economy: the worst experience I have had for a long distance flight. I was lucky to get the seats with more space without paying as I was one of the last ones to check in. The airplane was so old that it is difficult to put a small bag inside the plane. What's more shocking is not having an individual screen for each passenger. moreover on the Paris-Miami flight the steward was not nice at all. While the hostess gave me a can of coke he only gave me a glass. The food was ok but very low quality compared to the price paid. On the return flight the food was just terrible no comment I did not eat it. Of course same thing on the return flight no screens and very old plane. The seat in front of me was all torn. I have tried many other airlines for long distance flights being in Europe or Asia and none of them were as bad as this one.,5/31/2015,1,2,1,1,2,1
A Clarke,1,Flew from MAN to GCI and then from GCI to BRS over Easter weekend. Not bad value considering they pretty much the only way of getting to Guernsey. Free bag soft drink and newspaper but you would want to be incredibly short to have any hope of being comfortable in these seats for any amount of time. The crew on board we very professional and pleasant to deal with and seemed to enjoy what they were doing. Flight from GCI to BRS was operated by VLM on a Fokker 50 that was as old as the hills still it had a lot more legroom than the ATR on the previous flight. Nice service by nice crew on a short flight.,4/22/2015,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
A Bergmann,1,Flight LH 409 Newark to Dusseldorf in September. Flight was operated by an older A340-300 which was in very good condition and had nice inflight entertainment on big personal screens (much better than on Lufthansa's A330s at the moment). IFE featured loads of movies and fancy stuff such as real time speed / altitude. Flight departed about 1 hour late. Nevertheless I could easily catch my connection to Vienna. Food was alright could have been a little more though. Drinks were always available. Cabin crew did a great job very friendly and professional. Seat comfort was good for Economy Class enough legroom and I like the 2-4-2 seating. Changing in Dusseldorf was very convenient (small distances and a nice airport). I'm usually very satisfied with Lufthansa.,10/12/2014,4,3,4,5,5,9
A Clarke,1,LCY-DUB BE1317. LCY is a breeze of an airport to use with free WiFi and very quick check-in I'll be using it again. The flight had chaotic boarding through no fault of the airline the computer system for scanning boarding cards went down and it had to be done manually but the staff were very patient about it. Some peoples bags were too big to be brought on board including my own and were put in the hold free. FlyBe really should stipulate how small the overhead lockers are but again it was all dealt with quite professionally. Once on board the lead purser had to start moving pax around to spread the weight more evenly which delayed take off by 20 mins. I volunteered and was given a free drink and snack as a thank you which was a nice surprise. Still managed to land on time to connect to my bus home. After reading so many of the hit-and-miss reviews on here I was hesitant and while they wouldn't be my first choice on this route I would consider them nonetheless if the price point was good.,1/21/2015,4,3,4,1,5,8
A Berrou,1,CDG-AMM on A310 AMM-CDG on A321. Both cabins were fine. The A310 was pretty old but it had fully reclinable seats. Good food with several choices. Friendly flight attendants. Both flights were on time. Lounge at CDG (shared with AA) was inadequate but the one in AMM was excellent. Very good value for money. At AMM airport there are dedicated check-in and immigration counters. I was able to finish all formalities in 5min!,7/13/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Clarke,1,Very short flight from Barcelona to Palma (FR 6362) yet the crew managed to do their inflight service and the usual thing of hawking a few scratch cards. What was more amazing is that the crew were in a good mood seemed happy enough to be there and actually seemed to like each other - they even had the pax laughing! After numerous FR flights with miserable looking crews this was a pleasant surprise. Maybe the new positively is filtering down to the cabin crew? Only downside is the trumpet sound or whatever it was when landing but great all round otherwise.,10/5/2014,5,4,3,NaN,5,9
A Berry,1,Round trip JFK-KEF-AMS in Business Class. Seats were wider meals were wonderful service was great and the onboard entertainment was excellent. Yes it is like domestic business class but the extended pitch of the seats compared to coach made it easy for sleeping. The trip went very fast compared to what it would have been like in coach on any airline. Economy Plus is located behind Business Class and it seems to be dark back there because it is by the exit doors and Coach Galley. If you aren't used to or can't afford Business Class on the major airlines this is a nice alternative and I would recommend it. Check-in is easy and the personnel are helpful. The use of the lounges in airports during a layover was a wonderful perk very relaxing and greatly appreciated.,5/29/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
A Clarke,0,I flew from Abu Dhabi to New York the plane was not an Etihad plane but an Indian Jet Airways plane. The plane was filthy they ran out of water and the toilets were so dirty my colleague were reluctant to use them. A 14 hour flight. Numerous people complained. Etihad code share with so many people now its a gamble what sort of plane and service you are going to get. I used to love Etihad but you no longer get what you pay for.,6/25/2014,1,2,1,3,1,1
A Beswick,1,LGW-ACE. On time new 737s comfy bucket seats good legroom free wi-fi was brilliant and a real bonus compared to BA and Easyjet. Staff were great cant fault it. You can also choose any seat for free at the time of booking including exit rows.,10/22/2013,5,4,3,5,5,10
A Cohen Goldstein,1,Flew AMS-CAN. The flight was okay. I can see why they do not have 5* and at the same time I'm surprised they have 4*. Being a very frequent traveller on Qatar Singapore Emirates I decided to give CS a go as their business class flights were very affordable. I think where they fail is what they offer to make your inflight experience more enjoyable. It's always the little things. Champagne offering cocktail offerings even food offerings! There were only 10 of us in the business class cabin and I was 3rd to place the food order yet they had already ran out choice. Their wine list is very short but was okay the teeny glasses they give aren't very nice though I think they are scared they will run out! The snacks on board was only a sandwich. Although the cabin crew gave great service their presence in the cabin wasn't that great there were quite a few stamping through the cabin to go to the galley past first class (or at least that's where I think they were going and not to sleep in the cabin! Entertainment on the flight was rubbish this is the biggest let down. The selection and choices of movies are very limited! Also they were very old. Like others I suggest you download stuff and watch it on your own iPad. I may fly China Southern again but to be honest for the price I paid I would fly Qatar business class.,12/31/2014,4,4,3,2,4,5
A Bez,1,VS603/4 10-22nd March. LHR-CPT return A346 Economy. Fantastic flights have flown with Virgin several times in the past year and their onboard product is very consistent unlike BA.

A Bird,0,Big mistake using this airline. There were no non-stop flights from Sacramento to Dallas so I took a chance on Spirit flying out of Oakland. Flight was delayed 2 hours 20 minutes which put me in Dallas after 2 am. This is the first and last time I fly Spirit.,6/23/2014,1,1,1,1,1,1

In Dubrovnik there was a 2 hour delay with no one telling us any information when we finally arrived to Barcelona running through to airport to only just catch our connecting flight.

A Bjorndalen,1,"From booking with 'Canadian affair' to collecting our luggage on the return flight we were really pleased with Air Transat. Our YYC-LGW return itinerary went almost entirely without flaw. The ticket price for our itinerary saved my spouse and I an excess of $1000 over booking with KLM or Air Canada. We booked our seats in advance (21A & 21B on both flights at $20/seat/flight) and then utilized Transat's new online check-in. The online service was simple and easy to use with a dedicated bag drop and next to no line-up as a result. Our flights were both on refurbished A330-200 Twin engine Wide-body jets. The 9 across configuration Air Transat uses (over the typical 8 on most A330s) was noticeably tight but not impossible or overly uncomfortable and on the outbound flight we lucked out having the block of 3 to ourselves. Mood lighting on both flights was neat to watch and I actually agree that it made a difference in the overall perception of time and minimization of Jet Lag. The two airplanes had differing overhead bin designs the outbound being Airbus's new style curvy bins and the return being their older style. Although this doesn't seem like something the average person would care about the difference determined whether or not the seat had an overhead personal air vent. Only the older style bin aircraft was supplied with this feature - one I hate seeing airlines remove. It made the return flight all the more comfortable to have a little blast of cool air. Legroom on both aircraft was the same and is slightly above the norm I'd say somewhere around 33"" pitch. Transat's new inflight entertainment on the A330's is a great system with plenty of newer mainstream movies TV shows and music to choose from. Even the food onboard was good. On the return the food was more of ""microwave dinner"" calibre - each of us ordering 'orange chicken' but perfectly edible and of good enough taste. They are small though so consider packing a snack or taking advantage of their onboard purchase menu. Upon arrival of both of our ""on time"" flights our bags were delivered in good time even though we did not pay extra for Option Plus or priority baggage services offered. Overall we were incredibly pleased with the Transat Experience after reading some less than satisfactory reviews - and would absolutely fly with this airline (and to this surprisingly easy to access and navigate airport) again.",7/1/2014,5,4,5,5,5,9
A Collins,1,LHR-CMB-LHR in economy. Took advantage of 'Manage my booking' and 'Check in Online' on website which made things easier at the airport. However requested seat on outbound leg was changed without explanation. A330 both ways generally clean and tidy except for dirty marks on and around video screens. Despite being 'new' seats with lumbar support they are rock hard and I squirmed around continuously but never really get comfortable. Range of movies and music was good for economy although not AVOD. IFE system was a bit 'dicky' with handset showing signs of wear and tear on outbound but fine on return. Food drink and general cabin service super which mitigated other shortcomings. I would use this airline again - hope they can do something about the seats!,5/27/2012,4,3,4,4,5,7
A Coogans,1,"KBP-RIX. Check in agent at Kiev very polite. Air Baltic seem to be concerned about the hand luggage limits as every passenger's one piece of luggage was affixed with a ""Cabin Baggage"" tag. Boarded the Boeing 737-500 via bus not a very pleasant way to board a flight but out with Air Baltic's control. Very limited space on board for hand baggage the cab=in crew member's suggestion of putting it under our seat was a bit naive since both my friend and I were too tall to fit our feet under the seats with any bags there. Eventually managed to stow our small bags under the middle seat in front as it remained unoccupied. The crew were actually friendly but strict enough with certain passengers who broke the rules (standing up whilst taxiing etc) that they reassured you of your safety. Arrived in Riga on schedule most passengers were connecting elsewhere but for the rest of us the luggage arrived very quickly. I'd definitely fly Air Baltic again as they are very good value for money if you book early enough.",3/31/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Cooper,0,"Terrible for economy passengers! I flew business class with Etihad in 2012 - business class was bearable but when I flew in economy in Oct / Nov 2014 it was the worst airline I have ever flown with. The cabin staff attitude towards economy passengers is poor. My husband and I pressed the button once to ask for a drink and the stewardess looked inconvenienced by us. We paid $5000 AUD for the two of us to fly to Dublin and back and it will be the last cent Etihad ever get off us. The inflight entertainment that they brag about hadn't been updated so the movies / tv shows / documentaries that the magazine promoted didn't match what was actually offered - instead we had to watch old movies old tv series and the ""latest releases"" in the movie section were at least 12 months old. The seats are uncomfortable.",11/6/2014,1,1,3,1,2,1
A Blackwell,0,Business plus plan: Smoke and Mirrors. I just went on a business trip and took the opportunity of travelling with Ryanair on their new Business plus plan. Just as an aside I fly regularly with Ryanair (no choice) and usually book and pay for all the options so I went for 'all the options' in a package that promised a 'bit' more and cost 70 euros more. The flight was from Dublin to Nice (France). The offering was 1) Flexibility on ticket changes 2) 20kg baggage allowance 3) Fast track airport security 4) Priority boarding and 5) Choose your premium seat. So this was all pretty good and I bought into it all. I did not need to use #1. #2 is standard. #3 I wanted and at Dublin Airport there was a gate for this that put us behind people being let into the fast lane for clearance (no big deal). When it came to the return flight this was not an option. #4 is standard. However at Nice everyone was let through the check in at the same time (there were two queues) and most priority passengers were way to the back of the ensueing melee - all were then herded aboard a couple of busses so no priority. #5 is standard. Bottom Line: Business plus plan is a total fake intended to take more money out of business passengers without giving them anything.,9/17/2014,1,1,0,NaN,3,1
A Blake,0,Flight from Majorca to Gatwick on 23 October delayed by 7.5 hours. New plane had to be flown out. Seats in new plane even more crammed - both sideways and forwards than before. Nobody seemed to be keeping local staff informed as to whet was happening. Monarch used to be much better. One mark for landing at the right airport.,10/30/2012,1,1,0,0,3,1
A Cooper-Smith,1,Four of us travelled from Gatwick to Fort Lauderdale on the Dreamliner and we were all very impressed with the plane and the excellent service on board. Fort Lauderdale seems to have a problem with processing the amount of people on the Dreamliner. We arrived on a Friday night and had to wait for buses to take us to the terminal which took ages and then we had to wait outside the terminal as it was full! Took forever to get through customs even with a renewed ESTA! On return we had half hour delay and then had to return to stand because of a faulty switch. The terminal had no announcements to update people and shops and restaurants were shutting early. I would fly with Norwegian again but not to Fort Lauderdale I'm afraid. Our Hotel said this had happened every Friday so something is going wrong somewhere.,10/8/2014,5,4,4,5,5,9
A Bland,0,Manchester-Chisinau via Munich. Initial outward flight delayed due to crew 'being stuck in traffic' although all passengers were waiting at the gate on time (it was a full flight). Standard of slimline seating on Lufthansa flights not comfortable at all (way too hard even for relatively short flights). Cabin crew pleasant and drinks / snacks ok. On return journey Lufthansa had another delayed flight back to Manchester with plenty of seats still available that would have got me home much earlier than my booked flight but their 'customer service' staff in Munich wouldn't entertain allowing me on it that would be far too helpful for them. All in all nothing special for the price far too inflexible / not focussed on customers and I'll avoid Lufthansa in future for that reason.,10/22/2014,2,2,3,1,3,2
A Cornelius,0,Stuck in Belize for 7 hours because the plane did not leave Houston. No further explanation on the matter except that the plane never left. The United staff that rescheduled our connecting flights was extremely rude and not helpful at all. It almost seemed as if she was taking joy in the fact that we were all stranded there. Then every passenger was forced to stay the night in Houston. My flight was supposed to be the first flight out of Houston leaving at 7am so I get to the airport at 5.30 am to find out that now it doesn't leave until 9:00. Every single staff me member I've encountered or asked for help from is miserable and rude. This was a one time thing but I will never ever fly United again. It's been the worst airline experience of my entire life and I've flown hundreds of times.,1/14/2015,1,1,1,1,1,1
A Blaz,0,Flight number TOM4666 on 25th January to Sofia - took off on time. After 1 hour in the sky the captain informed us of a small technical problem and that we have to land in Munich. After 10 minutes we were landing in Munich. Having spent 4 hours in Munich airport we were informed that the technical issue was not resolved and we could not continue our journey. We were offered overnight accommodation. Next day after again 1.5 hours delay we finally took off and reached our destination. This awful experience was then followed by next delay on the return flight from Sofia TOM4667 on 1st February. Two hours were crucial for us as we could not reach our home due to plane landing after midnight. We had no other choice as to spend the night at the airport. Meanwhile we also tried to speak to Thomson staff at the airport with no result and no apology. Flying with Thomson was one of the most unpleasant experiences with airlines. Will definitely avoid them in the future.,2/5/2014,2,3,4,1,3,NaN
A Cotrim,1,"LHR-JNB (South Africa). Booking done from site www.britishairways.com and the check-in too. The time boarding was done with great quality in Terminal 5 in Heathrow airport (pier C gate 65) and schedule. Cabin crew was fantastic. The flight was very good the quality of the plane provides an excellent trip. Takeoff and landing very smooth. The ""rest position"" of the seats makes in upper deck the legroom a little tight. Do not choose the emergency exit seats because they do not have access to windows and are narrower because the table and the monitor are on the armrest. JNB-LHR. 747-400. It is a much older plane. However the trip was very good after crossing the storm just outside Johannesburg.",10/1/2014,4,4,5,5,5,9
A Bogojevic,0,Zurich-Singapore. A long 14 hour flight so during those long hours I expected only the best service. I arrived to my seat and realized I did not have a TV in-front of me. Not only that but my seat was broken. It would move as I leaned back and fourth. My TV was located on the seat to my right which meant for those 14 hours I had to lean to the side while watching a movie. I called the flight attendant over before take off and showed her the problems and asked what can be done. She said there was nothing wrong with the location of my TV and would not look at my broken seat. She just walked off and told me she would be back soon - never came back. When we first got on the plane there was no air con for at least 40 minutes. Everyone was using magazines to cool themselves down. I suggest in the future to not choose this airline. Service is very poor.,7/21/2013,1,1,3,1,2,NaN
A Coupe,0,Cardiff - Glasgow. Unable to check in online. Booked flights through ebookers. Air France flight operated by CityJet seems their online check in cannot cope. What's the point of having an online check in system that cant be used. Having to check in at airport seems to defeat the purpose. Called cityjet customer service 3 times and no one could help me or give an explanation a complete waste of time and money! Unhelpful unreliable and uninterested in helping customers.,3/31/2014,2,2,1,1,2,1
A Bolton,1,I am a regular user of Ryanair and I have always defended them as an airline with their rules my line would be stick to the rules and it's a cheap way to fly. I've never had a problem until now the new 7 day rule for printing off the boarding card is downright wrong. We hardly ever go away for less than ten days so we can't book our return flight in England. We go to rural Spain and I doubt we will find an Internet cafe now when everyone has wifi and Ipads I think they have all closed down. So now will have to pay for allocated seats and need to remember this when working out whether Ryanair are cheaper than Monarch.,6/8/2014,4,4,1,NaN,5,4
A Cowan,0,"We flew Air Canada 2 weeks ago (not Rouge) Toronto - Munich on an outbound leg to Athens. While boarding the craft in Toronto was a little disorganized the flight and service was great and the flight would have rated full stars across the board. Our return flight was AC 1901 Athens-Toronto only gets 3 stars for satisfaction as we did arrive safely and on time. That is really the only good thing to be said for it. This was an 11 hour flight through 7 times zones. The flight was half full so staff were not overworked. Unless you pushed the call attendant light they were only in evidence when the very poor meals were delivered (not served). No choice available limited beverage service followed 15 minutes later. One mid-flight trip down the aisle to slide some pretzels and 4 ounces of pop or juice onto your tray and two silent passes of an attendant with a bottle of water and the staff disappeared at least in our cabin. No entertainment available at the seat unless you were willing to pull out a credit card again to rent the airline tablet. The worst of it all was the total lack of comfort provided by the seat. We do not like having the seats in front of us recline so that is not really a problem however the seat design offers no support in the lower back and has restricted both aisle and window passengers from stretching their legs. The arm rest design means that you can inadvertently call the attendant or turn your light on or off. Others have commented on the lack of personal ventilation at the seat so I won't. A mixed blessing was having blankets and pillows provided prior to take-off. At 1pm this seemed a little like telling someone that they are being ""put down for a nap"". If you don't want them you must give up your limited space to store the items in the event that might want them. On the plus side overhead baggage storage was adequate (however this was not a full flight and might be a problem if fully loaded). Washrooms were adequate but masking tape holding dispensers and bins closed does not inspire confidence. As has become the norm the audio system was poor - either the airline staff need a lesson in microphone use and diction or the system needs an overhaul as most announcements were so ""mushy"" as to be indecipherable. Finally while we recognize that the airport is responsible at this point the baggage pick-up was a bit of a problem as the overhead monitors specified one carousel but the baggage actually arrived on a different one.",6/12/2014,2,1,1,1,1,3
A Boltwood,1,I enjoyed flying Porter out of Toronto into New York. Friendly staff and civilized service. The disappointment was flying back in foggy weather. My flight was redirected to Hamilton because the Island airport doesn't have good navigation systems for landing in fog and Porter's terminal at Pearson doesn't have Customs agents. Porter arranged buses from Hamilton to Toronto so they handled the situation well but the trip took much longer than planned. I would use Porter again for domestic flights but not rely on them for on-time arrival from the US.,3/16/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Cox,0,I really hate this airline sometimes. No major beef with the aircraft (I have only ever flown long haul on decent A330 aircraft) but the organization of the airline is terrible. It is basically impossible to speak to anyone who knows what they are doing or that has access to necessary information. Three times now I have attempted to book (either during reservation or after) bassinet row seats or biz upgrade only to be told that it is all full up and not possible. You get to the flight and find empty seats. Furthermore they want to sell the bulkhead seats for 45 euros but will not prioritise for people with young children. So first come first served basically. On the upside in biz I ate the best food I have had on a plane for a long time. Good antipasti great pasta and decent second course meat as well.,1/14/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,3
A Bonomo,0,Ft. Lauderdale Sep 4 flight 657 to New Orleans and departed Flight 680 Sep 5 from New Orleans to Ft.Lauderdale. This airline is the worst. I have flown many airlines and have never had such a bad flying experience. The staff were very rude and all the unexpected fees doubled my price. It is no savings with a small carry on at $50 dollars and if I want to sit by my child had to pay $18 dollars for seats together. So my payment went up $136 each way.. not so great the plane smelled fowl and seats are cramped and very uncomfortable. Make sure you book a massage the next day you will need it.,9/14/2014,1,1,1,1,1,1
A Craig,1,BLI to HNL on 26 December 2012. Alaska's in-flight staff were excellent on this flight. Three beverage services and free mai tai's before landing. The rented Digiplayer was delivered promptly after take-off. Staff were all very cheerful and did their best to make our flight enjoyable. Excellent work.,1/8/2013,4,4,4,4,5,8
A Boone,0,"Heathrow to LA in Economy. This was my first and last time flying with Air NZ. Firstly the best aspect was the crew friendliness. They seem good fun and genuinely happy to help. The ones I chatted to really hate the 777-300 aircraft. One said it wasn't designed to 4 seats in middle row and she seemed genuinely sorry for the customers squashed in a middle seat. A result of having an extra seat in the middle has meant that the aisles have got narrower. I really felt sorry for the crew having to walk sideways a lot of the time. I was in an aisle seat and was constantly being bashed by the crew and passengers waking past. Clearly they are trying to squeeze out as much profit at the expense of customer comfort. I paid extra for a ""preferred seat"" and apparently this includes a row behind a leg room seat. Not sure why I had to pay extra for this seat that was no different to any other regular row. When the guy in front put his seat back I felt so claustrophobic and could hardly see my TV screen. The food was very average and I waited over 80 minutes to be served an alcoholic drink with my meal. Being offered a glass of tap water just after take-off is very poor and not what you'd expect from a very expensive ""4 star airline."" The choice of films is very limited and very few new titles. I'll most certainly be flying on BA A380 next time I go to LA.",7/31/2014,2,1,3,2,4,2
A Crane,0,Took return flights to Australia via KL. Don't understand how MA qualify for 5 star rating. Outbound flights 17 Oct were both night flights from Heathrow and KL MH001 and MH123. First time travelling Business Class and didn't come up to expectations. Crew were noticeable by their absence and surly when present. Hospitality from the crew was minimal and not a smile in sight. Quality and choice of the food was disappointing lacking imagination. Return flights from Melbourne 04 Dec via KL. Both daytime flights MH148 and MH004 Crew were much better they seemed to want to deliver a good personable service making both return flights more enjoyable. Unfortunately the food again lacked imagination and therefore disappointing. To summarise standards of the crews on aircraft are inconsistent so its pot luck whether you have an enjoyable flight or not and food was consistently poor.,1/8/2014,3,4,2,3,2,5
A Boone,0,Very poor service at LAX from Air Tahiti staff. Flying business class on AA with a code share. They are having some dispute with AA so AA and Air Tahiti are refusing to let each other's business class passengers into their lounges but they don't tell you until you get to the lounge. With three small children and already on flights for 12 hours with a 6 hour stopover in LAX they refused us entry to the Lounge. The staff in the Lounge were kind. Air Tahiti wouldn't let us pay for the lounge without first going out of security again waiting 30 minutes for them to process the payment and receipts and then line up in security all over. Apparently they used to let people phone in the credit card number to avoid having to exit security but now they have decided they rather make passengers spend over an hour at their desk/security. We'll avoid Air Tahiti and AA for a long time.,1/6/2014,2,3,3,3,1,NaN
A Cristaudo,1,I flew with Spirit for the first time round trip from Las Vegas to Dallas with my 8 year old little girl. We were worried that our night flight would be canceled due to the weather in Dallas therefore we arrived at the airport early in the morning to fly on standby for an 11am flight. We were able to fly on the 11am flight with no cost increase and we were even given the more spacious seats. We carried two backpacks on the plane (1 per each) with all of our stuff therefore we had no luggage fees. Coming home we printed our boarding passes out at the rental car facility and there was no charge. To be honest I read all the rules called Spirit to double check everything and wound up saving a lot of money. Total cost was $180 round trip for both of us. I will definitely be using them again.,3/9/2015,5,3,4,1,5,10
A Boorman,0,London Heathrow - Yangon via Doha return. First three flights were okay - check in staff at LHR a little rude. Economy class seating meal options inflight entertainment all very reasonable but I didn't see the five star airline reputation particularly. Final leg Myanmar to Doha was overbooked and I was kicked off with nosearch for volunteers (seemingly as were a lot of other single male travellers) resulting in a 13 hour layover in Doha. Placed on a 2am flight home and Doha airport was dreadful - food appalling customer service desk rammed and understaffed the staff who were on duty were rude and nobody actually seemed to know where my luggage was. DOH-LHR I have never been treated so rudely by airline staff (told I was in the wrong area when I accidentally went to the wrong toilet). There was a total lack of organisation with this airline.,8/5/2013,2,4,3,4,2,3
A Crociani,1,"FCO-BUD-FCO both flights delayed about 20 min. in Rome for heavy traffic and this is not an Alitalia's fault on the return from Budapest 30 min. for some ""uncommon"" luggage boarding procedures but we ended up landing in Rome only 15 min. past the scheduled arrive. Cabin crew professional and polite. Will fly Alitalia again.",9/6/2014,4,4,3,0,4,7
A Crociani,1,Rome to Paris and return (FCO-CDG-FCO) first leg on a quite old A321 but well maintained return on a new A320. Our flight from Paris was cancelled no explication given but we were boarded on the last flight of the evening. I can't blame Alitalia for this issue it happens. The return was calm and all in all a good experience. Will fly again.,4/28/2013,5,4,3,0,3,8
A Bor,1,Paris-CDG to Taipei Taoyuan airport. My global impression of this flight is good. Cabin crew friendly and very professional. Service was efficient. Inflight entertainment quite good. However there were some bad points. The meal was very poor (just the main course with appetizer and desert but no salt no pepper and other things like in other airlines) and incredibly tasteless. Plus our flight had suffered from 2 hours of delay due to airplane problem. The problem was not the delay (it may happen sometimes) as we were provided food and water but the airport staff had apparently forgotten to tell me about the delay so I discovered it a little bit late! Yet the delay had been scheduled hours before departure. However my impression is that EVA Air is a good airline with a good cabin crew.,9/17/2013,3,3,1,4,4,7
A Crossman,1,BKK-HEL-BCL-HEL-BKK in business class. A330 business cabin BKK-HEL was spacious and the bedding comfortable. Quilts provided are not your typical itchy wool type quilts. Flights generally on time. Baggage allowance of 2 pieces up to 23kg each was favourable. 10 hour long haul flight was comfortable and service attentive. Requests for further drinks were met with a polite smile and efficiency. Self service area in the galley had enough treats. IFE on the long haul product is not as fancy as that on other carriers but had ample selection for the relatively short long haul sectors. A320 product within Europe includes business with a 3/3 layout with the middle seat kept empty. Drinks a plenty on this service as well and champagne served when the BCL takeoff was delayed by 20 minutes. Staff attentive and friendly. Overall a pleasant experience. Within Europe I find their product consistently better than a lot of their competitors in business.,8/6/2012,5,4,4,3,5,9
A Bor,1,"Return flight Jakarta-Denpasar. Check-in easy and efficient staff very friendly the plane was very modern. In addition we had individual TVs with video on demand! This is the first time that I have found an airline providing VOD system for a short-haul flight! Plane departed on time and for both flights arrived half an hour before schedule! The only bad point for my trip: I've waited for almost 45 minutes to get my luggage and thought they lost it. But actually they made a mistake by placing my luggage in the ""executive class passengers"" part of the arrival point. I highly recommend Garuda Indonesia for its high sense of service efficiency and reliability.",7/30/2013,4,4,4,4,5,8
A Csenki,1,Astana to Frankfurt and back in May 2013. We flew with a large group of small children. Airport staff were helpful with check-in and we were allowed to board first. Cabin staff were very helpful and friendly and dealt well with our kids (handed out children's packs on the way out for example.) Food was good quality and there were films showing throughout the plane (no individual at-seat screens in economy though). A pleasant experience overall!,5/29/2013,4,5,5,4,5,9
A Bor,1,RIX-SVO-PVG and back. From RIX to SVO it was a partner flight with Air Baltic. Then came the horror of SVO-PVG. I had no option to choose seats. I was asked in RIX while checking in for seat preference and I said aisle. I did get one for RIX-SVO and for SVO-PVG I got a 28th row which on their A330 is in front of the toilets and the seat does not recline. The seats were rather worn and entertainment system was slow though the selection of media was excellent. The food was plain insulting with 2cm of salmon sliced over some canned carrots and peas presented as a salad. The bun was hard and the choice of main course was chicken or fish for dinner and chicken or goulash for the supper. The dessert was surprisingly good though I had to wait 40 minutes for the tea to have it with while they were finishing servicing everyone. And now for the best part the service. Apparently they are split in the teams of 2 with some kind of good cop / bad cop principle as in both aisles we've seen one was making attempts to smile and the other one was plain offensive. The bathrooms were hardly cleaned the pilots announcements were hardly audible. So imagine my surprise when on the return flight from Shanghai to Moscow I was greeted by a very professional and helpful staff (still not smiling) got into a very comfortable seat of a brand new shiny 777 with plenty of room even with 3-4-3 scheme great new entertainment system with touchscreen much fresher air and the food was really delicious including a very fresh bun. The short flight SVO-RIX was also very pleasant with a nice little airbus with sufficient space a delicious chicken sandwich and soft drinks and the sweetest flight attendant. To sum it all I'd say its a real hit and miss thing with Aeroflot. Stay away from the airbus on the long flights make sure its a 777 they're great. If you're unlucky enough to get airbus steer clear of row 28. The food probably depends on where they get it. The entertainment is excellent on long flights tons of good movies TV shows and music. Do not expect a good polite service on every flight. Other than that flights were on time with great connections and very reasonably priced.,7/6/2014,4,3,3,5,1,6
A Curran,1,Travelled from Melbourne to Paris 11th Sep code share Cathay Pacific. While the seats on Air France were not as comfortable as Cathay the service was considerably better. The women who looked after us were fabulous. Friendly polite and happy! This fare was much cheaper than other business class flights but the flight did not reflect this. We were very surprised with our flight considering the reviews were not great. We will certainly consider Air France again.,11/1/2013,5,4,5,5,5,8
A D Moss,0,Delayed 10.5 hours on 1st November 07.00 flight from Gatwick to Lanzarote. Ground staff gave what looked like a standard letter with standard excuse for 'operational' delay. Given two Â£5 refreshment vouchers (two passengers travelling) and provided a 'brunch'. Apologies were scant and neither ground crew or air crew acknowledged extent of delay and severe inconvenience caused. Posting on this site may alert others to the atrocious service offered by Monarch.,11/13/2012,1,3,3,3,1,NaN
A Boreham,1,Short hop from BNE to AKL. Check-in staff member was helpful and friendly and the wait was minimal. The flight departed thirty minutes late but were kept well informed. The meal service was cheerful with a selection of mains. The in-seat entertainment was clunky and poorly designed and the language selection confusing to say the least. Seat width and comfort were as expected for economy and the staff pleasant and fluent in English. Overall an enjoyable and professional service.,1/12/2012,5,4,4,3,4,8

A Dahlberg,0,Tried to fly from Philadelphia to Bangor on 2 August. Waited over two hours for them to fix plane. They even boarded us and we taxied out to take off but they found yet another mechanical fault while we were on the runway. Returned and disembarked. Very rude ground crew. Flight then cancelled. Had to wait in a long line to be put on a new flight. Cabin crew from other flights dame and pushed in at the top of the line making our wait even longer! Could not believe how rude they were. Even though Philadelphia is a hub for them and the flight was fully booked they could not find an alternative aircraft. And lots seemed to be sitting around going nowhere. We took a flight to Boston. Very rude woman at the gate looked at my BA Silver card and yelled - You are not preferred customers! She did not even know who US Airways partner airlines are. We arrived in Boston on a plane with broken toilets. None working in Economy. There is always something broken on a US Airways plane. Our bags were sent to Bagnor. So we had to spend a night sleeping in our clothes and then drive out of our way to Bangor airport to collect them next day. I have never had a flight with this airline where the plane took off on time and everything on board worked. Many flights were cancelled. Even long distance ones from London. I will go out of my to never travel with this airline again.,8/7/2014,1,2,1,1,1,NaN
A Borodin,0,Flew Bangkok - Tel Aviv LY082 and return LY081 September/October 2013. Extensive security interrogations bordering on the ridiculous. Once on board the plane was quite dated and dirty. Entertainment system was too poor to bother with. Food was reasonably good (esp. the breakfast). Onboard service was minimal and cursory (not so much unfriendly just not particularly hospitable - compared to the Thai flight BNE to BKK it was the diametric opposite). Drinks (of all kinds) were not being served regularly but only once with dinner and there was no real selection. Overall it was reminiscent of Finnair on its Helsinki-Hong Kong flights but with an older aircraft. I would suggest avoiding this airline unless you have no other choice.,10/15/2013,2,1,3,1,2,1
A Borowsky,0,Trip to Fort Lauderdale and back to Toronto on April 12 and 19th. Boarding was disorganized. We were called to board and then made to wait in line before boarding this happened in both Toronto and Fort Lauderdale. Our luggage was off loaded in Fort Lauderdale but nobody announced which of the 13 carousels it was coming down at and the signage at Fort Lauderdale doesn't indicate it for Sunwing. The Fort Lauderdale check-in happens at the west side of terminal 4 the plane is loaded from the east side of terminal 3. Yes a different terminal and the opposite side too. It's a bit of a walk but doable if you don't have much carry on. In Toronto the plane touched down early but nobody was available to guide us to the gate only a 10 minute wait to get to the gate and another 5 or so for the door to be opened. Luggage came out an hour later. Staff near the luggage carousel were unable to find out what the delay was or do anything other than apologize once the luggage did start to come out. Meals - On the way down I had a breakfast muffin. It was warm on one half cold on the other. Soggy pizza about the size of a cheque book on the way back. I guess that it costs around $3 per meal they should just pocket that money and drop this lousy food. Charge me $10 extra and give me something well prepared and tasty. I don't see how I would willingly take Sunwing again. Hopefully my future flights will have other choices available.,4/22/2015,2,2,1,1,1,4
A Daniel,0,Travelled Business Class Melbourne-Hamilton Island return in the last 2 weeks. 3 hour flight at $1600 return. Whilst the Cabin Manager was friendly efficient and professional the overall product is really substandard for Business. Seats with no footrest limited recline dirty and scuffed nil storage. No pillow or blanket available anywhere on the aircraft. They don't stock them even for Business. Refreshment on the way up consisted on a small tart tub of yoghurt and a roll. Nothing else. Lunch on the return no pre lunch drink a small hot meal bread roll and small cake. Not even a salad. No sparkling available and no bloody mary mix for a bloody mary drink. No hot towel. No amenities at all. IFE consisted of a portable tablet which is annoying to place on a small tray table. Again couldn't fault the Crew who were fantastic. Just a shame they have such a basic product to work with.,7/27/2014,1,2,2,2,5,5
A Datye,1,I always hear people complain about how bad Jet's service is but this flight from BOM-BKK-BOM had a perfect on time performance for the two way trip. Food was decent nothing to special for a four hour flight and since we flew on a 737-900 jet there was common TVs throughout the flight so entertainment was hardly any but surprisingly they showed good movies on the flight. So overall experience was alright and I would recommend this airline.,11/28/2013,4,4,3,3,4,7
A Bottin,0,London City to Antwerp was delayed 3 hours 40 mins not sure whether it's true that there was a technical problem as the airline claimed or whether they just cancelled the flight and let us wait for the evening flight one never knows. Got a voucher for 5Â£ could just buy 1 small drink with it a small packet of nuts and crisps. Were not informed at check-in about the delay so had already gone through security. Representative for cityjet at London City airport very unfriendly not even apologizing for this long delay.,4/10/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,1
A Davids,0,Flew Sydney - Beijing - London. Both planes were old tatty and cleanliness left a lot to be desired especially the toilets. Both flights were delayed. For the second flight the scheduled time of the flight from Beijing to London was changed at the last minute. No delay was mentioned anywhere in the airport. Nothing was communicated by the airline the time just mysteriously changed from 14.30 to 16.10. When the staff were asked about it they either pretended to not speak English or just didn't. No apology was issued on the flight. The plane was sitting at the gate for hours before the flight was due to take off so no excuses there. We already had an 8 hour stopover so the extra couple of hours wasn't welcome when our total journey time was already 30+ hours. The entertainment system didn't work at all on my seat - not good for an 11 hour flight. Didn't matter as I had my iPhone loaded up with videos / music except Air China won't let you use your phone on the flight even with flight mode switched on! The food was pretty rubbish and the aisles seemed narrow. I know you get what you pay for and I'm not a fussy person for but I won't be flying Air China again. I previously flew with China Southern from Sydney to London for a cheaper price and it was a much better experience.,12/29/2014,2,2,2,1,2,2
A Bowdler,0,Three flights in as many weeks from Southampton to Manchester and each time a significant delay. Just arrived with the web service showing no delay to a shocking 4 hour delay to a fifty minute flight! Change the name to Fly maybe me thinks!,8/13/2012,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Bowen,0,Like all budget airlines Aurigny charge over the odds for credit card booking. Â£3 per person to encourage you to reserve a seat is a joke - they automatically allocate seats not next to each other upon web check-in - meaning I was at the back of the plane and my partner at the front. Plane's are very old. Leg room OK but wherever you are in the country (we were flying from East Midlands) it's never usually much more then an hours flight. Overall the flight is a means to an end.,3/9/2012,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Davidson,0,"This review relates to a 5 flight itinerary booked with United. Other than flight segment 3 which was with Lufthansa from Barcelona (BCN) to Munich (MUC) the other 4 flights were with United Airlines. The problem started when United had a schedule change which did not allow us a legal connection in Newark (EWR) on the outbound flight to Barcelona (BCN). We received an e-mail from United informing us of a change in time to an earlier flight from Phoenix (PHX) to Newark (EWR) allowing us a legal connection for our flight. This in itself was a bit annoying since we went from an original connection time of one hour to a four hour connection. Unfortunately we ""accepted"" the change on-line which was the first error on our part. The day prior to departing from Phoenix we received the usual message telling us we could print our boarding passes. This worked fine until we checked the boarding passes only to find out there was no longer the priority boarding we had booked and paid for. This resulted in spending over an hour on the phone to United. As it turned out with every segment flown with United it was necessary to go through the whole process of having them reprint boarding passes which showed the priority boarding and then only after we had provided them with proof this had been purchased. As for the flights themselves? The usual experience of dealing with disinterested flight attendants barely edible food and the fact as I was told ""United no longer offers special meals (eg: low cholesterol or diabetic) but does provide a kosher meal for its Jewish and Muslim passengers and a beef free meal for its Sikh passengers. So all in all the poor service of United Airlines appears to be the norm more and more these days rather than the exception which really is a problem for the UA's promise that we are ""flying the friendly skies"".",2/20/2014,3,3,1,3,1,1
A Boyd,1,Flew from Toronto Pearson to Milan Malpensa direct. I must say I have no complaints whatsoever ok the food was average but its airline food so why complain. The whole experience was pleasant.,7/31/2014,4,4,3,4,4,9

A Bradley,0,MNL-SYD. This was a horrendous flight! The plane was older and rattly. Luckily it was a night time flight and most was spent asleep. If this was my first time on Philippine Airlines I would never travel with them again! But luckily this is the first time I've had a bad thing to say about them.,8/8/2014,2,2,2,1,2,3

A Brandsma,0,Flew with AF from Amsterdam to CDG transfer by bus to Orly then on to Guadeloupe PTP. Overall experience was disappointing. However I arrived on time and I had plenty of legroom due to the seat (10J). But the onboard service was nearly non-existent no response whatsoever after ringing the attendant button. Entertainment system crashed every 5 minutes. No drinks offered only with the distribution of (mediocre) food. Orly airport staff were slow rude and unfriendly.,1/5/2015,3,3,1,1,2,5
A Davis,0,TOM7238 BHX-KGS 01/07/2014. Waited in a line for one hour due to a missing crew member who came strolling down like she didn't have a care in the world. Only to get onboard to be told we had another 30 minute wait due to missing our slot. Once we finally got into the air the crew did a chaotic drinks service which seemed rushed and unorganised. It must have become all too much for three of the crew as they decided to take a seats in row one for 20/25 minutes taking about their children. Just before landing one of the crew members did the most pathetic congratulation to a just married couple I have ever heard she even put the tannoy down before finishing the sentence. The return flight (TOM7239 08/07/14) at least had crew that seemed interested and actually interacted with the customers.,7/13/2014,3,2,3,1,3,2
A Bree,1,On November 13 2014 I flew with Iberia (flight 6118) from Miami to Madrid Business Class. The check-in boarding and welcome by the staff was excellent very friendly and punctual. My seat was 8A which was a very private Business Class seat. As the plane's departure time was 22.50 I skipped the meal and fall asleep right-away on the fully flat bed. The breakfast just before arrival was simple but good. I will not hesitate to fly again with Iberia up and down to Miami. A great airline and the Airbus 330-300 is great. From Madrid I flew on Iberia Express to Amsterdam. The business class is very cramped but adequate for a 2 hours flight.,11/20/2014,5,5,4,3,5,9
A Davis,0,BWI to CLT. Gate agents and flight crew provided conflicting information to passengers causing unnecessary confusion on multiple accounts and required zone 5 boarding passengers to gate check carry-on bags containing electronics when ample overhead bin space was indeed available. As a frequent flyer I have watched as this carrier has gone way downhill since the unfortunate merger with American. I hope to be able to avoid them as much as possible in the future.,7/31/2014,1,3,0,0,1,1
A De Heyn,1,BRU-BCN-BRU - B-light. On time. Online check-in is very efficient. I enjoyed the flight. Very friendly staff and attendants. A319 new recargo seats with enough legroom. Drinks and snacks available for an acceptable price.,4/29/2012,4,4,4,0,5,9
A Briggs,0,We pre-booked a transfer through Wizz Air for when we flew Luton - Cluj. We waited an hour for our taxi and decided to phone to ask where it was only to be told that they had picked someone else up and no they weren't going to send anyone out to get us no they weren't going to refun the money and that in fact it was all our fault! We had to pay for another taxi to take us to our hotel which was half the cost we had already paid through Wizz Air. I tried to claim the money back from Wizz Air I have written 2 emails and 6 weeks later I am still awaiting a response. Think twice before using!!,12/18/2010,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Deagle,0,My wife and I recently travelled with Sunwing to Cancun for a two week vacation. The flights to and from Cancuun consisted of rude staff poor service and horrible food. When we arrived in Cancun it took SunWing 2 hours to arrange our transfer from the airport to our hotel leaving us and a number of other guests who had young children standing on the curb for that time. Our return flight originating in Cancun was a disaster. During check-in the agent informed us that we were over our baggage limit which was not possible as we were returning with the same bags with which we had arrived (no additional weight). When we explained to them at length that we had purchased an extra baggage allowance and showed the receipt they replied we did not that we only had advanced seat selection and early boarding with our additional purchase. This was not the story we got either from the agent when booking or at the Calgary airport agent during check in. They both stated that the package we bought included extra baggage. We ended up having to explain ourselves to the check in agent the manager and another customer service rep but to no avail. We were told the only way we would be able to take our bags home was to pay an additional $100 or to take our bags and leave. We were given two options: either pay for the additional baggage or take our bags and leave. Of course we ended up paying the baggage fee of $100 but we left feeling very disappointed in our choice of booking on SunWing especially when we had other choices for this trip. We had made our decision to book with SunWing based in part on the additional baggage we would be allowed but it is clear that the additional baggage offering is not what it appears to be. We will never book with Sunwing again and advise others to find other vacation providers. We travel frequently and have had some great experiences and some mediocre experiences nothing we couldn't live with. But this experience is by far the worst and was worth taking the time to comment about.,1/19/2015,1,4,1,1,1,1
A Brown,1,Singapore to Helsinki on a lie flat seat less room and a bit hard to get to sleep on as you keep sliding down towards the end compared to Qantas A380. Nice pillow and duvet though. Food reasonable and a nice touch being able to access the menu online before the flight and make your selection. Flight attendants very friendly and would give other airlines a run for their money. Helsinki-London are all economy seats however business class have the middle seat of 3 blocked out giving you a bit of extra room. Nice lounge in Helsinki. Return flight delayed out of Heathrow due to fog and with only 40 minutes between the arrival from London and next leg to Singapore. This was a bit of a worry but in the end it was not a problem as the Singapore leg waited for passengers from London to arrive. Didn't use the AVOD. Finnair gives value for money and when full flat seats in Business class are implemented it will be better.,10/21/2011,4,4,4,0,5,8
A Decolt,1,Panama City to Caracas - a journey of 2 hrs. There was very little legroom but we were served quite a decent meal and considering it was a short flight I was impressed. We departed on time but arrived 20-30 min late.,8/18/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,7
A Brown,1,10 October BKK-UTH on A320. Full flight. Crew professional. How they manage to serve a full flight with the meal and beverages in 50 minutes and also tidy everything up is really amazing and all for 1040THB (approx. 20GBP).,10/13/2014,5,4,5,0,5,10
A Dempster,1,Having booked with Thomas Cook (flight only) to Dalaman I was expecting the worse after reading the reviews. Left on time from Gatwick seats fine for a short flight staff really friendly food good. On our return we had a tight connection to Jersey flight arrived 30mins earlier than expected. Staff were pleasant and once again food good. No entertainment but really not a problem. Overall experience very good.,8/28/2012,4,3,4,1,4,9
A Dennis,0,United overbooked my flight. They asked me to take a later flight to Hawaii when I refused they changed my flight anyway which gave me a five hour wait at the SF airport. They offered nothing for this inconvenience and acted as if they were doing me a favor. This was my first and last trip on United.,4/6/2014,2,1,2,1,1,1
A Brown,1,Udon Thani-Bangkok. A Very good budget airline. Served a sort of Pizza with a water. No juice or Coffee unless you want to purchase it. Crew did not seem very happy to be working.,3/21/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,7
A Brownson,0,Manchester to Barcelona 23/11/12. Without doubt the most uncomfortable seats I have ever encountered. The legroom was appalling. Have used Monarch before but they seem to have sacrificed economy legroom to get a few quid off the few prepared to pay for tolerable legroom. Never again.,11/27/2012,2,1,0,0,3,2
A Devane,0,Luton-Gdansk. I'm 6'4'' and found that I couldn't fit in the seat as they are spaced too close together. I brought this to the cabin crew attention and paid Â£10 x 2 for my Girlfriend and I to move seats. On return trip I was stopped at gate by staff as my bag (cabin approved) was oversize and would have to pay Â£30. I explained that I had just flown out 2 days previous and had no problem with my bag size. She was rude unapologetic and robotic in her manner. After paying she handed me my receipt without so much as a thank you or sorry for any inconvenience. I sat twisted in the cramped seat with my right leg out onto the walkway. There was no way I was giving them another penny for extra leg room and to top it off the announcement at the start of the flight stated that 'our passengers comfort is our priority during this flight'. Definitely not value for money with all extras added.,2/13/2013,1,1,0,0,1,NaN
A Buckley,1,Newcastle-Dalaman. Asked for extra legroom at check-in and got it at no extra cost. Flight on time plane clean and staff quite polite. Drinks no more expensive than say Thomas Cook or Thomson Airways. Legroom in ordinary seats looked average announcements for safety ok but quite rushed and quiet. Dalaman-Newcastle return on time no issues with the flight other than an older MD-83 aircraft which was more cramped. Quite funny to see the cabin crew sleeping however during the flight - not sure about the safety aspect of that.,9/21/2009,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Devries,1,YVR-PSP-YVR. Both flights on time staff friendly and the planes are clean. I like this non-stop seasonal compared with connecting through SFO or LAX with UA. The only drawback was the small TV screens.,11/28/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
A Burgey,1,We had excellent flights on Meridiana as we traveled from JFK to Naples and back. The plane appeared to be fairly new and the cabin clean. I might also add that the departure flight and the return both arrived ahead of schedule. There were 6 flight attendants on the return flight to JFK including 4 stewards and 2 stewardesses. They were particularly attentive and the food they served was excellent. Beverages flowed throughout most of the trip and that included complimentary wine. We flew Economy class and had no issues at all. If you are considering a flight with Meridiana do not hesitate they exceeded our expectations.,6/20/2014,5,3,5,0,5,9
A Dhuuka,0,DXB-CAI-LHR after completing 3 flights with MS in the last month I can definitively say it's the worst international carrier I've had the displeasure of travelling on. MS fail to provide a fair level of service for its premium passengers no priority boarding food comparable to CX economy and tardy slow service from the crew. MS provide lie-flat seats on its long haul fleet found it difficult to find a comfortable position to sleep.,7/26/2012,2,3,1,3,2,2
A Busk,1,MEL-KUL-HKT return. Value for money flights on time and for a budget airline great cabin service. We prepaid for meals seats and comfort kit. Meals were fine we ordered a kids meal for our 12 year old on the long haul flights and they came as good as any full service airline. Good Australian wine RM 18 (AUD $6) available. Seats recline to a comfortable level.

A Difiori,1,Flight SQ318 (SIN-LHR) Suite 3A. I had the fortune to fly in one of the suites on my return trip. The service in this class is what you would expect private entrance at the airport with the added bonus of a separate security channel. I was taken to the SilverKris lounge and upgraded from the 1st class lounge to the private room. This was a great experience especially having a cook to order breakfast service and a nice sized dinning room. The boarding service itself with a private walkway to the suites was very speedy and as soon as I arrived at the plane door you are taken to your suite by a steward. Seated and then given a guided tour of all the facilities and features. The service itself was amazing if not a little over attentive but being served my the most senior stewards you would expect this. The food was good although some items were a little overcooked. I would recommend this but only if you have about 10k to spend without missing it. The suite itself it very comfortable and when the bed is made it was large enough for me to lay out fully even being 6ft2.,12/7/2013,4,5,4,5,5,9
A Butler,1,"We fly JetBlue about 3 times a year, and every time it's satisfying. The legroom is great in even more space, the television is great for entertainment and they actually give you something more than peanuts.

A Byers,0,I just traveled with my mother to Miami Florida from Calgary Alberta in April we bought our tickets online a month before our trip. We received the flight information by email everything was going fine. The flight down to Miami was great however the return trip was a different story again we checked-in the night before to save time but they overbooked the flight from Dallas to Phoenix and my elderly mother had to pay an extra 35 dollars to be guaranteed a seat on the flight to be able to stay traveling with me. I was asked to check in my carry on in Dallas because they were not going to have enough space in the overhead compartments. When we arrived in Phoenix they announced that the flight was overbooked and asked if anyone was interested in staying overnight and catch the morning flight to Calgary they offered to pay for the hotel and give you a travel voucher I could not take them up on the offer as I had already checked my carry on in Dallas. We bought our tickets a month before I felt that our seats should be guaranteed. The only saving grace of the trip was that the stewards were very nice on the flights.,5/8/2015,2,2,2,1,4,4

A Dixon,0,"HV5078 NCE-RTM on 14 Oct. Bad weather resulting in partial airport closure. Initially flight delayed by 3 hours but passengers were allowed to check in and wait at departure gate. Flight further delayed and rescheduled to leave next morning (12 hours delay). Passengers forced to leave departure level to the main level and ""recheck in"" again next morning. Complete chaos at the airport ground personnel never bothered nor cared to arrange hotels for stranded passengers blaming adverse weather and non availability of hotels. Dinner coupon of 5 euro offered which you could buy a stale cold sandwich. Spent entire night sitting and waiting and thus flew out next morning after spending 15 hours. Transavia could have been kind enough and courteous to offer free tea/coffee on the flight way back considering this huge delay.",11/21/2012,1,2,0,0,2,NaN
A Cai,1,MEL-WEL-CHC-MEL. One of the best economy class trips - smooth and efficient. Arrived in Wellington early. Staff really good. Surprisingly the Airbus 320 was very comfortable. No food if you are on a budget air-ticket. Highly recommended.,11/11/2014,4,4,1,4,4,9
A Dmitry,0,Night DME-KJA-DME 5-hour-flight. Got a Web check-in with the boarding pass sent to the mobile however still had to rush about the airport looking to print out the paper pass as there were no electronic boarding pass procedure at the airport not even a way to print it out quickly at the Check-in kiosks after the registration was closed (was registered 10 hours before the flight). Inflight service was slow and poorly organized It would make more sense on a night flight to start and finish the flight service during the first part of the flight to let people rest rather than drag it out through the whole flight. Seat comfort was close to nothing - literally no leg room (I am 180 cm-5'11) - its a shame to pay normal price for a low-cost service.,11/19/2012,2,1,3,1,4,3
A Cairns,1,We connected from our Bangkok to Abu Dhabi flight (EY401) which was horrendous. However we were pleasantly surprised by our flight EY45 Abu Dhabi to Dublin (9th December 2014). The crew were fantastic attentive professional efficient especially the male crew member. Nothing was too much trouble. The business class cabin is still one of the most cramped we have travelled in but the cabin crew made up for any discomfort.,12/18/2014,3,2,4,4,5,8

A Doherty,0,Luton to Geneva. Always surprised by their baggage policy. I was just 1 kg over (21 kgs) and the check in assistant charged me. It's not a problem but I was just thinking the person in front of me weighed at least 95 kgs and is not charged for their 20kg bag. I weigh 65 kgs and have to pay for 1 kg over. Appreciate you cannot charge based on a person's total weight but for some reason it seems unfair. Also they are not very consistent - I often carry 21 kgs on Easyjet and they do not charge anything - could depend on the mood of the Easyjet check in assistants. At Luton the assistant said the Managers had asked them to charge every person on that day.,9/12/2013,2,3,3,NaN,3,3
A Campbell,0,I booked through 3rd party which prohibits you from choosing a seat at all and no confirmation until 24 hours before. Used the mobile application to check in terrible application to say the least and no paperless option like United. First time I've ever had to pay for a carry on and normally fly United or Southwest. Got to the gate and they made everyone put their bags through a pre-check to make sure bags were the right size. What a hassle for those who travel all the time. Frontier used to be a good airline but they're just making it difficult for customers to travel with them. This is the last time I will ever fly with this airline.,11/19/2013,1,0,1,1,1,NaN
A Domican,1,Flew business class Dublin to Abu Dhabi return and was very impressed. The driver collected us on time and the lounge in Dublin is excellent. Cabin crew on both legs very professional and also very friendly at the same time. Food and wine top notch and loved the fact you can eat when you want and what you want. The beds are narrow but comfortable. The only gripe is that the lounge in Abu Dhabi is dreadful. Its overcrowded and too small. To say this is their signature lounge is a joke. Passengers were sitting on the floor as there were not enough seats! This is part of the flight experience but its letting the product down big time.,6/10/2014,4,4,5,5,5,7
A Canepa,0,Stockholm to Prague was OK nothing to complain about. Sandwich not the best but not the worst either. Don't understand why they serve coffee and tea together with the sandwich instead than returning after a while but that's not a big issue. The return was very disappointing. I travelled with my husband and we had only one checked luggage weighing 22 kilos one piece of cabin luggage and my purse. We had to pay the 2 kilos overweight because we had two separate bookings! The check-in lady told us that she has to follow the (Austro- Hungarian) rules and she doesn't want to lose her job. We replied that she will for sure when the customers will choose other companies.,6/7/2009,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,1

A Carlos,1,"JFK-ICN Economy. A380 is very roomy inflight service is excellent very good food. IFE with very good film options. Very good idea to have a duty free shop at the rear of the plane as it also has lots of room if you want to stretch a bit during such a long flight. Cabin crew very professional and courteous.

A Douas,1,ATH-LHR A321 new and clean . Sat in row 4A perhaps too far front as the you cant see the TV screen at all due to the fact it is placed on the Business Class Divider (first 3 rows are business class). Flight well priced and I like the fact that their tickets are changable by paying a small fee. The food was fine but portions were too small. Asked for a second meal which was provided after 5 minutes. The luggage collection landing in Heathrow was too slow and took forever. Despite these small issues Aegean Airlines is an airline that I enjoy flying with and the best choice by far out of Athens.,5/23/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
A Carter,0,Travelled with my 6 year old granddaughter to Malaga on 27/10/14 (ZB654) returning to Manchester on 31/10/14 (ZB655). Booked through Avros. Because I did not book directly with Monarch I was only allowed 5 kg of luggage per person and could not print boarding passes online. Both flights were on time and the pilot was very informative. I pre-booked seats to ensure that we were able to sit together and had seats 11D and 11E on both flights. It was the same aircraft on both flights I know this because the seat pocket for seat 11E was hanging off! There was a wodge of paper hankies stuck in the emergency exit door. I am 5 ft 7 inches and the leg room was totally unacceptable only one inch between my knees and the seat in front. I now realise why in the safety demonstration we were not given instruction on the brace position was because it would be physically impossible to do so on this aircraft. I would definitely never choose to fly with Monarch again.,11/3/2014,1,1,0,0,3,1
A Douglas,0,Our first and last time using Southwest. We flew from New York (LGA) to Chicago (MDW) over the Labor Day weekend. Outbound trip was ok but the return was chaotic. Our return flight was scheduled for an 8pm departure but was delayed to 11pm due to some weather issues which we can understand. However they kept changing the departure status from 11pm to 10.30pm to 9.10pm and then to 9.45pm. When they changed it to 9.10pm this was when we had to scramble to the airport. We managed to make it to Midway but we were scattered on the plane even when we had Boarding group A. Either way it is best to avoid Southwest Airlines at all costs.,9/4/2013,2,1,3,NaN,3,2
A Driver,0,I flew business class with TAM recently from London to Sao Paulo and back. Fortunately this was paid for by the people who invited me to lecture in Brasilia because if I had been paying I would not have been happy. The seating arrangements were reasonable but the service was poor at best and the food was sub-economy standard on most airlines. The poor service include having to ask for most things and not being offered anything (like drinks) more than once several mistakes on the breakfast order non-availability of several food items on the menus generally morose staff etc etc. This was really poor TAM - you are letting your country down and you need to get your act together with the Olympics looming fast!,5/20/2015,2,3,1,4,1,2
A Casley,0,Jakarta to Solo trip was horrible. Drinks are not given but sold they aren't cold and they don't serve the drinks with ice either. Extremely loud announcements no entertainment. The plane was pretty dirty and my seat pocket didn't have the magazine. In my row only one seat pocket had a magazine.,9/28/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,1
A Ceviche,1,I fly to MXP or LIN often from London and have to say Alitalia have one of the youngest fleets in Europe. Planes are spotless (unlike UK counterparts) and the service is always top class including the food. It's such a refreshing change from 5/6 years ago!,10/16/2012,4,4,5,0,5,10
A Dron,1,London City-Florence return. Usual swift check-in at LCY. Half-full Avro RJ85 took off on time. Interior slightly worn but clean and seats comfortable with just about enough leg room (I'm 1.83) for the 2hr flight. Staff professional handed out drinks and sandwiches (which were adequate but which could perhaps be upgraded slightly from slightly skimpy cheese or tuna mayonnaise). The basket of complimentary Belgan chocolate squares passed round later is a nice touch though. Return flight check-in handled by Air France at Florence. For some reason AF staff insisted that queuing passengers should print out their boarding cards from automated check-ins before dropping baggage. Flight similarly smooth although delayed by about 20 minutes due to late incoming aircraft for which captain apologised. Cabin crew made a second sandwich run offering more to anyone who wanted them. Overall good flights that were less expensive and better quality than those offered by Meridiana the airline we have previously used for London-Florence trips.,10/9/2012,4,3,3,0,4,7
A Chan,0,"Flew return (LHR to LAX) on the A380. Condition of the aircraft is good as the aircraft is new. BA had first business and economy on the main deck and business premium economy and economy on the upper deck. This was good as it avoided the vast spaces which could make the cabin look like cattle class. The food service was acceptable and has not changed much (except for the smaller portion) from which I first flew with BA about 15 years ago. Service was delivered in a professional and timely manner. The downside was the seat design. BA is trying to fit a remote control video screen tray table and storage space all on the seat back. This makes the tray table and video screen far too small (back to sizes that I experienced back in the 90s). This made the travel experience felt like cattle class as the seat dimension is typical economy seat size. All other airlines have improved the travel experience by improving the economy seat design. The worst experience was on the return leg when a passenger absolutely refused to put his seat upright during the dinner service and this was after I asked him repeatedly. This resulted in my tray sloping down and the dinner tray and tray table hitting my stomach. The cabin crew just shrug me off when I asked him to ask the ""gentleman"" to put up his seat for just 10 minutes. Come on there is a big difference between good service (not upsetting customers) and just avoiding difficult situations.",12/18/2014,3,3,3,2,3,7
A Dron,0,London Heathrow-Sao Paulo return. Overnight flights both ways. Boarding efficient at both ends. Boeing 777 with 10-abreast economy cabin which felt cramped. Legroom just about bearable - I'm 1.82m and my knees were touching the magazine pocket of the seat in front (pocket seemed to jut out considerably which had noticeably detrimental effect on legroom). Meals served soon after take-off on both flights and were quite skimpy but perhaps no bad thing so late at night. Cabin crew retired to galley after meal service and were not obvious until breakfast. Variety on IFE was limited but there were some reasonably modern films that passed the time. In all a very average (and somewhat tedious) 11-hour flight.,3/25/2013,2,3,3,3,3,5
A Dubiella,1,BKK to CMB 18 April UL887. Lounge in BKK is the Air France Sky Lounge which is big but very basic and with limited Food and Beverage Service. Low quality Wines and no Champagne served (in an Air France Lounge ). Very good organized boarding with separate doors for Economy and Business Class. Old style Business Class seat in an A340. Good enough for a 3 hours but very bad if a long distance flight. Very limited video program audio did not work at all. Good dinner but kind of rushed service by very friendly crew. On Time arrival in Colombo. For the same low price I would not mind flying again with UL.,4/23/2013,5,4,4,2,4,7
A Chang,0,I had pleasant flight on REX  I had both SYD-CBR and CBR-MEL.... well done for Rex. Even though the costs and fleets they are using nowadays can't beat virgin and qantas but the service are unbeatable..overall I think they deserve more supports from all of us,8/26/2004,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Dumitru,1,OTP-KIV-IST return. OTP-KIV canceled due to fog instead put on the TK service to IST. For the IST-KIV on well maintained Embraer 190 with friendly and professional FAs. KIV-OTP delayed 1.5 hours but they kept passengers informed. Boarding was a bit chaotic as they could not figure which plane should depart first. They used a fairly old but clean A320-200 and staff were nice. For the price paid attentive service and helpful staff.,1/19/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Chappell,1,Amsterdam to Berlin. I do love Schiphol and the Dutch. A great airport and a great airline. On time friendly professional. Can't really complain too much. Good as always.,6/19/2013,4,3,5,0,5,9
A Durand,0,Brussels to Bilbao on 25 December. No delays were indicated on the website nor at check-in. But when departure time arrived things got wrong. A 1 hour delay was announced. After a while change of gate and an airplane was there but no crew! On Xmas day there was not much traffic and runways were active. Some passenger had been going to the airport for the 3rd consecutive day due to cancellation linked to snow. A new 1 hour delay was announced with no clear indication that the flight would leave. There were children old people and a pregnant woman. We had to pressure and harrass the airline agents to get food vouchers as legislation provides for. Eventually we left with a 3 hour delay. Information was non0-existant. Flying with Brussels Airlines is a poor experience.,12/31/2010,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,3
A Chauhan,1,NZ443 Auckland to Wellington on 18 April 2014. The seating on this flight was comfortable enough but the connection from an international to a domestic flight at Auckland airport really needs to be improved (though this is obviously not the fault of Air New Zealand). The flight itself however was delayed and no calls were made about the delay until 40 minutes after the scheduled departure time. Better communication is needed.,4/21/2014,3,5,0,2,3,7

A Chetal,0,Heathrow to Mauritius seats are very tight spaced. Staff quite unhelpful. In such a long haul flight they did not distribute water or juice after meal times nor did they advise passengers to help themselves with drinks in the catering area. I travelled with 18 month old twins - staff unhelpful and gave our kids meals with adults meals whilst distributing other kids meals earlier. Mauritius to Heathrow staff rude and spoke over our heads literally bitching about kids playing on the floor between passenger seats. They lack manners and customer service. Staff have no compassion and empathy for parents who travel with kids - they behave as if they are doing us favours whilst we pay in full for adult and kid fares.,2/4/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,1
A Eastwood,1,BHX-GCTS 26/1/2013. Flight on time pa system from flight deck very poor (much crackling and background noise) returned 4/2/2013 same plane all on time. PA system this time was excellent the captain gave abundant information and was very clear.,2/7/2013,4,4,0,0,4,8
A Chinnery,1,This flight is OK. The new Ryanair is the same quality as easyjet or Norwegian. There are improvements which made the journey fine and we will fly the airline again. We got to new Stansted airport and the experience was OK. Boarding opened 1 hour before and began 40mins before. The plane departed on time and smoothly. There are no advertisements on the overhead bins and there where no scratch cards. An ok trolley came with food for sale. OK priced. Better than the airport. We landed 15mins early and no fanfare? It was a shock but fine so you don't wake up suddenly. It was a good trip with an improved service. Travelled 17/08/14 STN-LRH 07.30.,8/20/2014,4,2,4,NaN,2,8
A Edon,0,Tom 2200 8th July MAN-JSI (Skiathos) on B757. Plane took off on time fairly clean but showing its age. Cabin crew ok but did the minimum and pulled the curtain across blocking the use of front toilet. Note to cabin crew its a curtain and not a wall you can hear everything they say. Return Tom 2201 22 July JSI-MAN again on B757. Cabin Manager loved the sound off her own voice never off PA system! Plane clean but again past its sell by date looks good from outside though. Very bumpy on return and again Cabin Manager serving drinks at 2 pax at a time ok as in turbulence but after 15 mins no turbulence but continued to serve drinks at 2 pax at a time? We had Britannia Airways free headphones / free entertainment / free newspapers / cabin staff that loved their jobs now we have Thomson / First Choice. Pay for everything Tea / Coffee / seats constant use of PA selling this and that. 1 drinks service on both flights but all hot food is cooked and what's left (huge amount I saw) is thrown away. Can Thomson really afford to throw it all away on every flight! Can we please have cabin crew who look like they enjoy their job more face to face contact rather than look above. A better uniform would look great too some of the shirts looked very creased.,7/27/2014,1,2,2,1,2,6
A Chinnery,1,WOW Air is a ok low cost airline and with some improvements (online check in boarding) would be a good efficient airline like easy jet but with a better cabin. The flights where dirt cheap at Â£300 for 3 people with 1 bag and reserved seats. Flight WW206 16/2/15. LGW-KEF. Aircraft:TF-WOW. Check in opened at 16.10 for the 19.40 flight. It was quick and there where 3 check in staff. The flight was nearly full today which shows they are doing well. We have reserved seats which we did get and they did acknowledge that when we booked we had the 12kg hand luggage allowance. Boarding opened at 18.40 for the 19.40 flight and we went immediately to the gate. Boarding was chaotic as they where boarding in rows and people didn't listen causing delays. It was painful and needs to be improved lot be like the procedure at KEF. We pushed back at 20.00 (late) and we were off at 20.15. The flight was good with comfy seats with recline. The buy on board was cheap in comparison with Ryanair and the crew where professional but chatty (a good balance). We landed at 23.10 in a blizzard. KEF was unprepared and we had to wait for 2 0mins to attach the jetway. Baggage was also slow but this wasn't wow's fault. Good flight but poor ground services all in all. Flight WW201 20/2/15. LGW-KEF. Aircraft TF-WOW. Check in opened at 04.45 for all the morning flights (06.50-07.00-07.15). (Ours was at 07.00). Check in was quick and there were 5 staff for 3 flights which was OK. Our flight was also again nearly full. KEF airport is a good airport in terms of departures. We went to the gate at 06.00 and the gate area opened at 06.20. Boarding began at 06.30 and they just let everyone one which was easier. This time the plane was bang on time for pushback at 07.00 and was up at 07.07. The flight was yet again good with a cheap buy on board and yet again a drinks round and a tea or coffee round which is good in comparison with easy jet. The plane landed at 09.40 (15mins early) and we were off at 09.50 baggage handling however needs to be faster. No entertainment was available. WOW air needs to add online check in and enhance the boarding experience at LGW before I can say it's a decent 3 star airline.,2/24/2015,4,4,3,1,4,6
A Ektarawong,1,BKK-MCT-MUC return. Flight to Muscat was about half full so plenty of room to stretch out. Entertainment was fine and watched a new movie and several TV shows. Economy class seating was spacious in a 2x4x2 configuration. Food was average and not much of it but wine was plentiful. Hot wrap snack before arrival into Muscat was just ok. Muscat airport has no jetways so buses are involved. Both sectors took no more than 10 minutes total and was well organized. The airport was fine though the Duty Free seemed overly expensive but there are several decent food outlets including Costa Coffee. Flight to Munich again was half empty so we could stretch out but once again the food was just average though they gave us several bottles of wine and water. Return flight from Munich to Muscat had 42 passengers total on the flight. We were the only ones in the front economy class cabin and were served within 10 minutes after take off and lights out 30 minutes later which was great as the flight leaves at 10pm. Slept 5 hours straight as we made beds from the middle section with many blankets and pillows. Better than first class! Flight from Muscat to Bangkok was 100pct full so I was now wondering what the service would be like. We had 2 seats together at the window in 2nd cabin with no room to stretch out but again the seating is great and the best economy class at 34 inches I've been in. Service was efficient and quick even with a full flight. All sectors the cabin crew were friendly and welcoming. Nice towel service all flights and good amenities kits handed out on each sector. Entertainment is fine and no issues and could recharge my phone and laptop as well from any seat. My only issue was the food. Little of it and not very appetizing though on one sector the vegetarian lasagne was good. Water bottles were also handed out immediately after service on all sectors which is a great idea. If I was not Gold with Etihad I would fly them again though you do get Etihad mileage by flying Oman but just not the bonus miles for Gold or Silver level. Good experience overall!,8/8/2013,5,5,3,5,5,10
A Chomowicz,0,"Very unlikely I will use Frontier again. Three of us flew from NYC to Portland OR on Dec 2 2013. I bought the tickets through a 3rd party so I had no idea they charged for both checked and carry on bags. Frontier is the only airline that charges for carry on bags. I believe these are hidden costs that they're passing on to consumers and that this practice is unlawful. Aren't the airlines required to disclose all costs? Also their system of charges is complex as is the various ""classes"" of customers. I am so annoyed at having to pay an additional $110 for the bags.",12/10/2013,1,4,0,0,3,NaN
A Ellis,1,"Flight 484 DFW to PHL 8/28/14. Flight 215 PHL to DFW. 9/2/14. We had a good experience with Spirit Airlines. Some people only see that they ""nickel and dime"" you but the truth is they gave a reduced price so that all the other things can be optional. We liked the plane we flew going out to Philadelphia and coming back to Dallas too! It was great and one of the things I liked most was the great customer service from the crew.",9/6/2014,5,3,4,4,5,8
A Christodoulou,1,LCA-ATH-BRU: Very average experience. Flying from Larnaca to Athens flight arrived on time to the destination seat space was ok food was horrible. Inflight service very average. Nobody expects anything special flying economy regarding food but what Aegean served for breakfast was beyond words. A tasteless omelette there was liquid coming out of it plus a small chocolate. The second segment of my flight from Athens to Brussels was better in leg space service and food but I find unacceptable the control they have on hand luggage. Lately they introduced the low fare tickets for people travelling with just hand luggage people of course try to benefit from this. Passengers carry in the cabin what they would otherwise have checked at the check in counters! What is happening is that people carry oversized suitcases and try to fit them in the overhead storage holders and I was really surprised to see that they allow this. I was carrying a 6 kg soft handbag which I placed in the overhead holder above my seat and the air hostess asked me if she could move it in a holder further in the other row simply to fit a big suitcase! The most positive aspect to this airline is the convenient times.,2/21/2014,3,3,2,3,2,5
A Emanuel,0,This airline is the worst! As I'm typing this review I'm sitting in an airport waiting on a delayed flight. It was Spirits first flight of the day from PHL to Myrtle Beach and the weather is perfect for a Labor Day weekend so one would not think a flight would be delayed. The reason for the delay is that the flight staff got in really late last night so in order to stay in compliance with the employment rules they must rest. I completely understand that but instead of Spirit sending the passengers an email/text because they had advance notice of this delay they just let people show up at the crack of dawn for nothing! Any savings you get from purchasing a Spirit ticket will be offset by extra fees (extra time spent for parking in the garage seat fees baggage fees and tons of indirect fees) lost time (I could've slept in) headaches and bad customer service. My first and last time flying with this airline. Future passengers you've been warned.,9/1/2014,1,1,1,1,1,1
A Chryssos,0,The plane was old all toilets except one in first class stopped working 2 hours before we landed on a transatlantic flight from Philadelphia to Athens Greece. The food was not edible the flight attendants were rude! The entertainment system was ancient and the movie stopped 3/4 of the way and could not continue. My nephew traveled a few days earlier and had similar complaints. My worst transatlantic flight in the 50+ years I've been going back and forth!,8/13/2013,1,3,1,1,1,1
A Epps,0,This is the worst airline I've been on! This company is very poorly managed. The airline nickles and dimes you for everything. Be careful to read everything before you book because they charge extra to reserve a seat which by the way are uncomfortable and do not even recline. With the exception of 1 employee that I encountered they are not friendly people. None of the flight attendants seemed to like their jobs. None of the employees seem to know their jobs. Our flight departed 3 hours late. Then when the plane couldn't land at our destination because of bad weather they took us to another destination. OK anyone that has flown understands that these things happen. But the attitudes of the workers and the lack of communication made this a horrible experience. We were stranded for almost 7 hours after we were told that ground transportation was being supplied to get us to our destination. What should have been a 3-hour trip turned into an 18-hour ordeal. I will never fly on this airline again.,6/4/2015,2,1,0,1,2,NaN
A Chung,1,SYD-PEK in First Class on B777. New First Class hard product looks great is functional roomy and comfy. Inflight entertainment very Chinese focused slow and very poor International movie/TV selection. Screen size large but low in resolution for a new product. Food and Beverage service Premium Economy standard at best. After 1 hour into the flight the staff ran out of Champagne which is ridiculous with only 6 people in First class of which only 2 (including me) had a glass of Champagne. Service was friendly and tried but obvious standards are lacking displaying lack of training or procedures. In short: Hard product can compete with the best but service is not international First class standard at all.,1/21/2015,3,4,2,1,3,4
A Faccioni,0,"Sydney to Abu Dhabi - August 14th Flight 455. Abu Dhabi - Istanbul - August 15th Flight 97. We paid $8000 for a business class trip to Europe from Australia. 2nd leg on the way over we were downgraded to economy with no warning no explanation (until we complained) and a totally inadequate $200 ""bribe"" to shut us up. Add to this a 1 hour delay taking off several staff not caring at all of our inconvenience a broken AV system in my economy seat and I am sure you can guess that I would never recommend this airline ever again.",8/26/2014,1,1,1,1,1,1
A Chuter,0,We left on the 1st Feb LHR - JNB - CPT. The checkin was fine but the flight was the worst I have ever experienced! The crew: not one glimmer of a smile no please no thank you it was as if they resented serving us and we did not feel at all looked after. The Food: one mouthful was more than enough - disgusting! The entertainment system: the map never worked and my touch screen was broken - just shrugs from the crew my partners headphones only worked in one ear. The worst thing was the temperature my partner works outdoors and will often refer to 7c as 'balmy' but on this flight we froze as did everyone else - what is that about SAA? The flight from JNB - CPT was a little better - the staff were at least a little friendly. The return flights were a little better but but the food was again totally disgusting and I am used to airline food. The entertainment system did work but had a very poor and very old selection of films. The cabin temperature was again unacceptably cold. We will never fly SAA again and will warn all our friends and family of our experience.,2/25/2013,1,1,1,1,1,NaN
A Feather,0,Flew Toronto to Las Vegas with Air Canada Rouge. Didn't realize when booking that this was the new discount airline. Had to pay $25 each each way to check a bag. When we got to the airport flight was delayed by an hour due to issues with the plane. Kept announcing more and more delays. Flight crew showed up then left. When our plane was finally ready to go no one could get a hold of the crew had to wait another 10 minutes for them to show up. Carry-on compartments were small attendants spent forever trying to rearrange them to fit everyone's bags. Maybe if checked bags were free people wouldn't be trying to cram so much into their carry-ons? Seats were cramped no TV screens at all. You can download an app for your iPad to watch movies which they tell you about on the plane (app has to be downloaded before boarding). Or you can rent one of Air Canada's iPads for $10. Food was awful not worth the $30 it cost. Usually like Air Canada but will never fly with Air Canada Rouge again.,5/12/2014,2,1,1,1,2,3
A Cielek,0,Frankfurt (FRA) to Zanzibar (ZNZ) with Addis Ababa stopover. Unfortunately I could not board my initial flight as the flight was overbooked and the local airline staff very unqualified. It came as a big surprise to me that the flight was overbooked as we had verified our seating numbers on our tickets just days before the flight. As such I will not travel again with ET as this was a very disappointing experience.,7/3/2013,3,3,3,2,3,NaN
A Ferdinands,0,Have returned recently from Mombassa - outbound journey not as bad as last year. Seats still very uncomfortable. Internal flights via Nairobi to Mombassa - crew were helpful and happy.

A Clack,0,I have flown Virgin Atlantic over many years in all three cabins over a number of different routes but I have to say I was so disappointed at the cost cutting going on in relation to in-flight service for my flights to and from MCO. For the so called 'premium' meal service we were given after the meal empty paper cups and then had to wait another 10 minutes for a hot drink. It honestly felt like I was in a train buffet car - not even a plastic cup. Breakfast service was disgusting a meal given to you with no drink whatsoever no water no orange juice nothing and again the paper cups came out after 15 minutes - BA WT+ offers fruit muffin orange juice a hot drink and a hot meal for it's breakfast service - honestly never been disappointed before but won't be wasting my money with VA again. On a positive note the best thing on the plane was the entertainment system.,1/10/2014,1,2,1,4,1,1
A Ferguson,0,"MAD-IST-SIN in business class Dec 27th. TK use a shared AENA run lounge in Barajas T1 but it's spacious and food/service offering has just been improved and is good but seats are really old and need a good clean. Flight to IST in brand new 737-800 with comfortable 2-2 seating. Good inflight meal and entertainment. Transfer in IST was horrific - poor signs and the transit for VIP passengers is not highlighted so easy to miss. Miles of walking and it looked like a building site. The lounge was simply overcrowded and staff at reception had an ""I don't care attitude"". Onward flight boarded early no separate line for business class and departed on time. Inflight service and airline image ruined by an inept crew that messed up the service and were shoddy. This is a shame as the product could in principle be very good but we'll not fly TK again.",1/3/2014,3,3,3,0,1,6
A Clark,1,Flew ORD-MIA on April 20th. The overall experience was very average. We flew American with miles and because United's flights to South Florida are infrequent and poorly timed and AA has a lot more options. All crew that I encountered didn't seem like they cared. The flight arrived on time and bags were waiting that the carousel. The aircraft flown was a 737-800 and the seats were surprisingly comfortable. Wifi was very good and it was only 7 or 8 dollars. The north terminal at Miami is very long and if you are making a connection allot extra time.,6/5/2014,5,5,2,4,3,6
A Fest,1,SIN-RUH-FRA. First leg was in a very nice 777 which was one of the most convenient flights I have experienced. Spacious leg room endless entertainment options and nice food. Transit in Riyadh was interesting as we could leave the airport after a strange procedure that took 2 hours but it was worth it as I don't want to stay in any airport over night if I have another option. Second leg to Frankfurt wasn't that nice. The 6 hour long flight was in a small A320 without much entertainment and with worse comfort. It would be ok for a flight half as long as this but for 6 hours after a rough night was really a bit hard. Staff on both flights were alright nothing special though I would definitely fly with them again great value in my opinion.,9/13/2013,5,4,4,4,3,8
A Clark,1,"April 26 FLL-CLE. My friend flew with miles and I flew for $400. Not bad considering that it was booked 3 weeks in advance and during a popular travel time. Check in crew and gate agents at FLL are outstanding. So friendly and willing to help out. The check in crew were smiling and friendly and helped out with checked bag issue. The gate agent was the best I've seen. She was so helpful to the passengers in wheelchairs and kept everyone fully informed. The crew onboard were friendly and very attentive. Always asking customers if everything was ok and picked up trash frequently. Somehow the flight departed 40 minutes late due to there being only one operational runway in FLL. We didn't hear the captain inform us about it or speak once during the flight. The flight was completely full. The flight was on a A320 with the new slimline seats. The legroom was adequate for my height of 5' 10"" however the seat was very hard and didn't recline very far. I purchased the wifi and for $5 was a great deal. No music or overhead screens on this plane. Connection through Cleveland was very easy and the airport was very easy to connect through. Flight from CLE to ORD was 60% full and had another great crew. They were very enthusiastic. The flight was operated by a 737-700 with very comfortable seats. Not one person on board purchased the over priced direct TV. Flight arrived on time bags quickly arrived at carousel. Overall United was decent. A bit overpriced but was on time with friendly service.",6/5/2014,3,4,3,1,4,7
A Fielding,0,Horrible delays and disorganization. The only positive about this airline are flight attendants. The economy class seating is extremely cramped on A320 aircraft and I did not experience their 757 because they swapped it for a SunExpress 737 on my last trip. This airline is extremely affordable and much quicker than train or bus while travelling within Turkey. I still prefer the service on Turkish. Food service is provided on all flights something that seems to be popular within Turkey. They offer a grilled cheese sandwich or a piece of pound cake.,4/3/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,5

A Clarke,1,Two flights the first EI 564 DUB-BCN and the other EI 739 PMI-DUB. The first took off late due to the late arrival of the aircraft which was the truth (refreshingly) as the aircraft only arrived 20mins before we were due to depart but the time was made up with a fairly quick two hour flight to BCN. Not a full flight so we had space to move and didn't have the usual cabin baggage issues. Took the cabin crew a while to get going with inflight service but they had everything we asked for. The crew were nice if a little robotic. Plane wasn't spotless but they were in a hurry to go again so understandable (it wasn't filthy either). The flight back was packed and the airport in Palma is awful one of the warmest airports I've set foot in. The usual issues with pax and their cabin baggage while this is not the fault of the crew it should be dealt with or pax should know how to stow their luggage efficiently. It seems to rather aggravate the cabin crew that they are reduced to baggage handlers and rightly too. Otherwise there were similar crew-bots to the ones on the way over. Did everything by the book and kept the lights low for anyone who wanted to sleep. As per usual the bags took an age to arrive and this seems to be quite a regular occurrence now. But as an experience but flights were absolutely fine and pretty good value for money.,10/5/2014,4,4,4,0,5,8
A Firth,1,"Flew LHR-CMB. A330-200. I was apprehensive about my trip after reading reviews on this airline. I needn't have worried. Check in at LHR was very efficient the only time I have ever been able to have a joke and laugh with the staff at check in. Boarding was slightly late but flight still left exactly on time. Being over 6"" I had an aisle seat a lot of legroom for an economy seat! Encountered turbulence over the Channel staff were very good at dealing with passengers that clearly did not understand what the Seatbelt Sign meant. Amazing food followed by a very comfortable sleep the cabin heat was turned up to make it very cosy for a night flight. IFE is very dated but you can live with it Sri Lankan are supposedly updating during next year. Landing was an hour early and baggage was ready for collection very promptly. A very pleasant experience and looking forward to the return!",10/16/2013,4,4,5,3,5,8
A Clarke,1,Flew from DUB-BCN. Never a problem on EI clean plane nice crew reasonable (ish) price for snacks and drinks and T2 in Dublin is a breeze. Why they don't try and sort it out and try to become a 4 star airline is beyond me if Virgin Australia can do it and they can't touch EI on some levels then what's stopping them?,7/22/2012,5,4,3,0,5,9
A Fitter,0,31.10.14 - LHR to Berlin Tegel. Flight out good modern plane clean food ok and cabin crew good even pleasant. Return 3.11.14 1625hrs from Berlin horrid. Crew only interested in themselves. Was tossed a cup of coffee and a snack. Staff openly ate the left over food from Business Class in the rear galley. I have complained about this before but clearly BA dont find it unpleasant. The return crew reminded me why I try to avoid BA.,11/6/2014,3,3,1,1,1,4
A Flores,1,SIN-MLA one-way Economy class on A330. The cabin looks tired. Seats are ok. Food was tasty. The flight attendants are polite but they lack the smile and hospitality that I'm used to when flying PAL. Overall experience still good. Price is cheaper as compared to other full-serviced airlines in the region. Definitely will fly again on this airline.,9/16/2013,5,4,5,3,3,9
A Foley,1,DUB-DUS-DUB. Outbound flight light load had breakfast not bad value and quite tasty. Remote stand in DUS but efficient transfer via bus so no complaints. So return last night full flight (215 people). Departure at 9.20pm. At about 8.30 at gate announcement made asking everyone to go downstairs collect bags and exit for bus transfer to Cologne where our aircraft was! Turns out curfew at Dussledorf means no jet aircraft after 10pm. Inbound flight was delayed which would have prevented a departure prior to 10 resulting in an overnight. All handled pretty well to the point that obviously this was not the first time this happened! Bit of a pain back through security etc in Cologne and people who had bought duty free in Dussledorf had some issues. Ended up arriving in Dublin at 1am about 3 hrs late. Flight itself fine. My only comment is on one attendant. Few German lads in row opposite me having a few drinks. A bit spirited but nothing to bother anyone. In fact the young attendant on board had a few laughs with them chatting about best pubs to go to in Dublin. Then as other attendant passing they were a bit loud and I noticed her giving them a hard stare. I travel a lot and know when people are behaving in a poor manner but not in this case. She had a furious look the whole trip. Ok so like the rest of us on a Friday night not impressed running so late but we were all in the same boat and I thought the passengers were remarkably stoic and took it all on the chin.,10/28/2013,4,3,3,0,4,8
A Forrest,0,"Manchester-JFK. Cannot believe there were no monitors in the back of the headrests instead monitors on the ceilings so far away you could barely see. The so called inflight entertainment (1 film for a 8.5 hour flight) broke after 10 minutes of starting and was off for an hour then anyway. When the ""food"" turned up I was given some cold pasta as there was no chicken left so it was this slop or nothing it was inedible so left it. On the way home there was a 2 hour delay and a gate change from 1 to 35. This time I got chicken but service was done in the dark and again only one film for a transatlantic flight so no distractions there or back which meant plenty of clock watching. This was my first time with American airlines and I can honestly say its the most prehistoric long haul flight I've ever had the misfortune to get on.",3/17/2014,2,2,1,1,3,2
A Fowler,0,Disappointed with all aspects. I flew Ulaanbaatar to London via Seoul. Despite me telling check-in staff in Ulaanbaatar I needed my bags in Seoul as I had an overnight stopover they checked them through to London. The seats on Ulaanbaatar to Seoul leg had adequate legroom but the headrest was low digging into my back and shoulders. The food on both flights was terrible and inflight service was poor. Staff didn't have a good command of English and I could not understand the inflight announcements. Inflight entertainment was ok having spent Â£4500 on a business class return I was extremely unhappy.,12/25/2011,1,2,1,3,2,1
A Franke,0,VS20 flight from London Heathrow to San Francisco and back. We never got a chance to choose our seats (not during booking or before check in or at check in). Seats and leg room is tight. Found it even tighter (claustrophobic even upstairs). Food (especially breakfast) is a joke. Staff are not trying to help at all. Poor service. All the money must go into these fancy commercials. Worst part: Virgin lost one of our suitcases and it took them 9 days to send it. Worst customer service. Will not fly again.,9/16/2013,3,2,2,3,2,4
A Frederic,0,CDGâ€“PHL NOV 30 2014. CDG AA Lounge is over crowded. Only 3 men's lavatories for more than 100 people. Preflight drink in plastic glass. Pre-lunch drink with cold poor quality nuts appetizer salad similar to those available in a low-cost market. Entree and cheese were OK. Crew too busy to speak in the galley. No question for more bread wine or coffee. Seat is flat and ok so is IFE. Snack before lunch was a joke - a cheap pizza and a salad. Lavatories beetwen Business and Economy locked all the flight. No reason as to why!,12/10/2014,1,4,1,4,1,NaN
A Freire,1,I fly very often (1 round trip/month) VGO-MAD-ORY. I am very satisfied with the service offered. VGO-MAD always on quite new E195 with good legroom MAD-ORY with E195 or B737 in very good shape. On the first flights of the day you get free newspapers. Very good telephone customer service. I do not know about the quality of food as I never pay for it on the flight. I'd definitely recommend flying Air Europa in short-medium haul flights.,3/28/2014,5,5,3,4,5,9
A Frost,0,Never Again. Third holiday in a row that we have flown with Thomas Cook and each time we have suffered bad delays. Last one was from Dalaman to Manchester TCX2985 on 21st Sept 2012. - 1.5 hours late returning to Manchester. Thomas Cook will be our last choice for all future holidays.,9/23/2012,3,2,3,1,3,1
A Gaisina,1,Melbourne to London return. The Business Class deal was two for the price of one. The whole trip was most satisfactory. Pleasant service. Food not brilliant excellent flat bed seats. The timetable really worked for my wife and me. A very civilised mid day departure out of Melbourne and a not too early arrival into London Heathrow. Return flight left at 10am and got into Melbourne at 9pm the following day. I was very surprised that the 2 stop flight seemed less arduous than the usual one stop flight with most other carriers. Lounges are fine Royal Brunei use the United Lounge in Melbourne their own in Brunei of course and the excellent Etihad lounge in London. A very nice way to start a long journey. The no alcohol policy is no problem. You can buy supplies at the duty free and the cabin crew will happily serve you on board. The inflight entertainment is a bit bland and of course is nowhere near the state of the art systems. Would I Fly BI again? Absolutely.,9/20/2012,5,5,3,3,4,9
A Gaitan,1,GRU-IGU. Disorganized check-in. Only 2 desks for more than 100 passengers checking in at the same time for 3 different flights. The boarding was better. The 737-800 belonging to Varig were clean and neat. 1 hr 45 mins flight with just a few selections of cold beverages. For the price it was reasonable.,11/21/2011,4,4,2,0,5,7
A Gaitan,0,"Buenos Aires - Mendoza was delayed 4 hours no explanation. Once we arrived to Rosario the flight was delayed again due to ""technical issues"".

A Clarke,1,DUB-LCY (BA 4467) got the flight on sale for a pretty good price. Great legroom on the E190 and comfortable seats quick and hassle free boarding. Service was a bit slow but included a drink and a snack (enough for such a short flight of an hour) with the option for more if so desired. Would recommend. LCY is going to be my airport of choice when going to London in future was sitting on the DLR 15 mins after landing and at my hotel 40 mins after disembarking and the trip on public transport was only Â£4.80 rather the excessive cost/time from other airports in the area.,1/21/2015,5,5,4,1,3,8
A Galiani,1,"We were supposed to fly LPB-SRE in mid-July but a blockade on the road caused us (and quite a few others) to miss our flight. We went to the BOA office in La Paz and were able to rebook without change fees. Only paid the fare difference. Finally flew out on the 18th but had a several hour delay out of La Paz. While this was not handled all that well by the ground staff this seemed to be par for the course - every other flight we have been on this year (in the USA) has had delays. Boarding was easy. Once the flight was announced, everyone just lined up and boarded. None of the convuluted boarding typical of airlines in the US and it only took about 15 minutes to board the plane. Since checked bags are free, there was no hassle for overhead space. Plane was economy class only with decent seat pitch. No extra charge to choose seats. Despite being a short flight, cabin crew came around with a complementary snack box and beverages. Plane was an older 737 but in reasonable shape and clean - I have flown in much more dilapidated planes on the legacy carriers. We had made a mistake on our booking for the return but were able to call BOA and rebook for the next day. Again, only paid the fare difference, in this case about US$8 each. Return flights (with connection in Cochabamba) were on time and the crew managed a snack service with drinks on the 35 minute flight from Cochabamba to La Paz. On the shorter flight from Sucre to Cochabamba they handed out snack packs to everyone. All in all a very good experience. Crews and ground staff generally pleasant and efficient. No ""gotcha"" fees and the fare was very reasonable. A nice change to what seems to be the general experience flying nowadays. Recommended.",7/22/2015,5,4,4,NaN,4,8
A Clarke,1,"Over the past month I have been on four FR flights. The first two were short hops to the UK and back the first of which (to Manchester) the trolley service didn't even make it to me due to the short duration of the flight which I didn't really mind. The flight back from Bristol was a mess and possibly the hottest plane I've been on in quite a while. Overall the service wasn't too bad they left on time and popping cabin baggage into the hold at the last minute is a great idea really speeds up the boarding process once you're on board. Just back from Barcelona the flight over was as good as any but they ran out of certain items so one wonders what pax on the way back did for food and certain drinks and frankly the seat stays comfortable for just about the duration of the flight. Turns out I didn't have to wonder what the pax on the way back did there was barely even a bottle of water left on the plane I flew home on. The inflight service from the the back was incredibly slow which probably had something to do with the fact that the crew in this section clearly did not get along. This was maybe due to the lazy attitude of one of them who declared quite audibly that she wasn't walking back to the galley to fetch something as she ""couldn't be bothered"". I've been on a couple of FR flights in the past while where the cabin crew did not get along nor try to hide it at all which is something they could look at somehow. On the whole though I don't mind flying FR once you know what you're at and what to expect then you shouldn't have a major issue.",4/22/2015,4,2,3,NaN,3,8
A Galvez,1,Seoul to Hong Kong round trip. Flight to Hong Kong left and arrived early. The inflight entertainment was good although the English movie selection was a bit outdated. The flight crew was pleasant. Food was really good. Return flight left and arrived on time. Same thing for inflight entertainment. My headphones were broken but the attendant promptly got me a new set. Breakfast (omelette and croissant) was again really good. Overall great value for money.,1/25/2012,5,4,5,4,4,8

A Cogan,0,Beyond Appalling. Flight delayed by ten minutes departing Rome to LHR. As a result one passenger decided he was going to miss his connection in LHR. He was allowed disembark thus leading to a delay in departure from Rome of over 1 hour 30 minutes. Consequent late arrival to LHR. Missed connecting flight. Abandoned in Heathrow at 10.30 on a Sunday night had to book new flights miss a day work find a hotel for the night. Ground staff of no use whatsoever. Staff totally unhelpful. Taking things to a logical conclusion what was to stop more passengers disembarking before departure thus delaying the flight ad infinitum.

A Garry,0,Left at the airport in Jamaica for 7.5 hours only to be told the flight was cancelled. Now at 11pm we needed to find our luggage go through the process of finding hotel reservations along with 100 other passengers. The next direct flight home to NYC was in two days. The following morning Delta tells us that our flight leaves in 40 minutes. Now we need to pack and get to the airport fast. We flew business elite and it was so disturbing to find that the armrest was broken and that no wifi or TV. Our choice of meal was eggs or cereal? Should have gone coach. The flight was not cheap and expected more. Realizing now why Delta is not our normal choice of airlines.,3/4/2015,2,2,2,1,5,NaN

A Gautam,0,"KUL-KTM. Arrived at the airport to find out that the flight had been delayed by over 3 hrs no prior notification from the airline whatsoever premium check in was quick and was told by the check in lady that the flight had been ""re-timed "" a good substitution for the word delay I suppose. Boarding meant for 2.30 pm did not even commence by 3.15 pm and there was no information passed onto us. Only after a few angry passengers made their way to the gate counter were they told eventually at 4 pm that the flight had been cancelled. Again no apologies at all and we were made to sit for almost 90 mins before they let us out of the gate lounge way back through immigration and then get out bags and finally onto a bus to the hotel that was arranged for us for the night. The flight eventually flew the next morning at 9.30 am. The way Air Asia X staff handled the situation was worse than appalling no apologies no information passed on in fact they seemed the ones who were agitated with all the questions being asked to them and not us who were there at the airport by 9 am and only got to leave at 5.30pm. The plane an Airbus 330 was clean and the inflight service as per your AA standards.",9/23/2012,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,2
A Coles,0,"I took a flight from Hong Kong to Newark. Appalling from the moment I stepped on the plane. The staff were very unwelcoming. My seat was behind the exit row which was empty - all the row was empty and seeing as I was sitting between a family who had been split up because of the shoddy seating arrangements we asked if we were able to use the exit row. The response (in an aggressive tone) was no! If you want to sit there its now been designated premium economy its an extra USD 170 each and you can pay by credit card! Note that this in the economy / coach section. The stewardess then made a big deal of slamming down all the dining trays on those seats as if to ""seal off the section"" - it all made for an incredibly unpleasant start to the flight. Aside from the small seats and lack of leg room when dinner came round I politely requested a cup of tea. The cup of tea was passed to me without any milk or sugar. I politely asked for milk and sugar. She stopped - glared at me and snapped - ""well you could have told me that when you asked for the tea"". By this stage me and the family I was sharing the row with were finding the staff so rude it was verging on comical. Then to top it off having spent thousands of dollars on this flight I learn that there is no free alcohol. Don't get me wrong I can go with out a drink for 16 hours but its a small touch to offer an alcoholic beverage as part of the service. Anyway an absolute shambles and I shall not make the same mistake of flying with United again.",9/1/2014,1,1,1,3,1,1

FA's were smiling pro-active and very professional which is a rare combo currently with Thai staff. The food was good and the 777 used for the flight clean. If only all of Thai's FA's were this good at their job.,6/13/2013,4,4,4,4,5,8
A Conway,0,"Awful airline and only getting worse. Due to budget cuts flights are often cancelled at the last minute and passengers are rerouted from direct flights to itineraries that consist of up to 3 extra flights. The airline will list several flights available but then combine all the passengers for that day on one flight. This makes travel with RAM impossible if you have a connection with a different airline. While travelling to Paris my husband and I had made separate reservations. For some reason he was told on a Monday that his Saturday flight had been cancelled. I was not alerted until Thursday that the same flight had been cancelled. My mother recently flew from JFK to Casablanca. It took her friend 2 hours after landing to receive her baggage. My mother's baggage was left behind in NY. We were told to call back the next day when the suitcase should have arrived on a flight coming in at 8am. The next day I called three times hours after the flight had arrived and was told that they could not confirm that the suitcase had come in. One customer service woman refused to let me speak to her supervisor and hung up on me! We ended up paying a 50$ taxi fare to go to the airport and were told to look for the suitcase ourselves by two employees who were sitting and gossiping and playing with their cell phones. Finally we found an employee in a back office who was willing to do his job. He went to another part of the airport and returned with the suitcase. The suitcase had a huge yellow tag on it that said ""RUSH"" and yet it was 8 hours after it had arrived and no one could confirm it was in Casablance. In short avoid this airline like the plague!",8/7/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

Other than that the cabin crew (all Polish) were smiling well groomed and acted with professionalism throughout the flight. The flight took off and landed on time with no issues at all. Wizzair have an ""Extra Legroom"" option available for a surcharge I think I will take advantage of this next time I am on a 3 hour flight with them. On a shorter sector I don't mind.

A Gibson,0,HTI - SYD - 2nd Jan 2014. Had a great time on Hamilton Island with the family. Arrived at the island airport to travel home and the check-in line went out the terminal down the ramp and into the car park. After about 35 minutes we made our way up the ramp and into the check-in area. One person to check-in 150 passengers. I did notice another Virgin staff member coming and going waving a radio around check a passenger or two and then disappear again. We had now been in line for 1.4 hours and it was apparent there was no way this plane was going to leave on time. 30 minutes before scheduled departure the staff member waving the radio around and another staff member arrived and the check in intensity increased. The plane left 15 minutes late due to the poor check-in. Once on board we were seated down the back this seems to be where they put all the young families a bit like a flying crÃ¨che. If the kids are going to scream let them all scream together. Prior to the flight we received an email from Virgin to download the entertainment app for the flight. We downloaded the app but alas the entertainment system on board was not working. Being in the 2nd back row the food cart eventually arrives and there is only a few crumbs left that that the other passengers didnt want. All the decent food had gone. Maybe they could start the service at the back of the plane and then move forward or carry enough of the good stuff for all. We were offered a complimentary noodle dish but it was too spicy for the kids. Once the food service was completed they started the rubbish collection I tried to hand over the rubbish to the flight attendant as they passed me but was told to hang onto the rubbish until they got to me later. The procedure seemed to be collect the rubbish from the front then push the cart to the back and collect the rubbish front to back. When we arrived in Sydney our bags arrived quick and we were on our way.,1/13/2014,3,2,1,1,1,3
A Cook,1,I have flown to Portugal and to Berlin and have found it a joy. The staff were friendly and although on one flight I had delays I can imagine that it would be the same with any airline. I'd recommend getting a larger seat as I do think the cheaper airlines have very small seats. Overall I always look for Easyjet first as I've had good experiences. The inflight food and beverages I tend to steer clear of as they are never that great but you can grab what you need when at the airport and save some pennies.,2/18/2014,4,4,3,NaN,4,10
A Cook,0,Gatwick to Dalaman. Both times I have flown with this airline have been really bad. On one flight I was so cold and they refused to get my friend a blanket.

When I got to the airport at Myrtle the lady at the counter told me my flight was not leaving until 4.50 because of a ""mechanical error."" I received no notification or email. She put me on a 10 pm flight to LGA without my consent. This is absolutely unacceptable for an airline. She refused to tell me that there were earlier flights available so I looked myself and found a flight on Delta which left 3 hours earlier. The staff at US Airways are so unsympathetic and simply do not care about the customers. I recommend flying any other airline unless US airways is your only option. The flight attendants refused to apologize for this too. Never again on this airline.",12/3/2013,1,3,0,0,1,NaN
A Cooper,1,23 December from LHR to Mumbai on the dreamliner. Plane itself was nice and the food and entertainment was fine although not much in the way of films/games for children. Luckily we had done online check-in for the connecting flight to Delhi as well. I handed in my luggage at the international terminal in Mumbai but this was not on the flight. After numerous telephone calls the luggage arrived on 26. Flight from Delhi to Chandigarh took off despite the pilot telling us there would be little chance of the fog clearing which meant that we circled above Chandigarh 4 times before returning to Delhi. Chaos on arrival and were it not for 2 helpful passengers things could have been a nightmare as no onward transport had been planned. It eventually left in the form of a coach 2-3 hrs later. For international flights AI is good but for domestic flights it is chaotic and staff are very unorganised. I would avoid Delhi airport if possible.,1/10/2013,4,4,3,4,2,7

A Cork,1,LHR-FCO. Flew out Club Europe courtesy of a reduced fare by BA. We thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The Lounge in the satellite was more relaxed than the main T5 terminal. As it was an early flight the food was fresh pastries and small bacon baguettes which were excellent. Nice way to start a journey. The flight was good. Very attentive staff on the B767. My colleagues had recently flown easyjet and hadn't flown Club before and were very complimentary about the experience. The return was economy on a new A320.

A Gipe,0,10/25/14 flight 581 from Bellingham to Las Vegas and on 10/26/14 flight 580 from Las Vegas to Bellingham. The trip down on flight 581 was severely delayed. Taxied down the runway only to have to come back to the gate when a warning light on the navigation system came on just before take off. At the gate 20+ minutes later they thought they had it all sorted out and were wrapping up paperwork went to push back from the gate and the light came on again. Thankfully after a few more minutes they let us off the plane and kept us in the terminal. Flight eventually was given permission to travel without the navigation systems but had to redirect flight path and had to fly at a lower altitude to avoid traffic. This crew was friendly and polite and the pilot kept us informed of all the things that were happening. The major downfall our flight landed almost 4 hours later than scheduled and the only compensation we received was a free $2.00 beverage. Flight 580 the next day was better in some ways worse in others. Again taxied down the runway and were next to take off when a warning light came on. We sat on the runway for about 30 minutes waiting for the issue to be fixed. Sadly the crew was very rude both in person and on the intercom barking orders and coming dangerously close to a yelling tone with passengers. This was not my first poor trip with Allegiant but it will be the last. The low ticket price is no longer a selling feature since they gouge you on fees for everything including printing a simple boarding pass. Driving to SeaTac Airport is about the same cost when you add in all Allegiant's fees but comes with the added peace of mind when it comes to mechanical soundness and pleasant staff.,10/31/2014,4,3,1,0,2,2
A Costa,0,BCN-LIS-BCN. Unfortunately we had a terrible experience from BCN to LIS. We pre-reserved seats which were not respected even being TAP Corporate/Upgrade Program with all the benefits of Silver/Gold TAP milles card. Check in at BCN was basic not giving a decent corporate service. I was not advised about the seats and lounge options. Flight BCN-LIS departed 40m late and have plenty of free seats. Airbus aircraft was dirty and old. The cabin crew served poor food (same food as economy). Drinks OK but no chance to repeat because the crew disappeared for the entire flight. Reading light was not working staff did not do anything to help. My return flight to Barcelona was better but the 2 hr 40min delay without any info is unacceptable. TAP corporate Lounge in Lisbon is small was pack smelly and they only served cheap snacks. Boarding by bus 40m pack inside the bus and the airplane was extremely old. All in all not a good experience to captive new customers. TAP is trying hard to innovate but the competition is always two steps ahead TAP.

Food service was late no water available unless you got up and went to the back of the plane. Food: The worst in the world. Snacks are nutritionally awful and are always served late. Seats on the flight from Toronto to Rome were falling apart fabric ripped in many places seats dirty no magazines or information cards. Few toilets were working properly.

A Crafar,0,I was traveling with my fiance and mother from NZ to Manchester in April 2014. On the SYD to AUH flight I had a live crawling beetle in my salad. I alerted cabin crew who attempted to remove it and return my salad to me! After following up the whole flight she finally said she had submitted an incident report. On the AUH to MAN flight the cabin staff gave our vegetarian meal to the family behind us. They started eating it and then the staff realised they had made a mistake so they removed the meal from the family behind us and gave it straight to us. The staff never returned when we requested water and it usually took 3 or 4 times until we got water. When I laid a complaint to the head office they offered my free guest miles and we stand by our great service and are offering you these guest miles. And that was it.,5/23/2014,1,2,1,1,1,1
A Gori,0,JNB-NBO-JNB. This trip showed both the good and average sides of this airline. JNB-NBO was on time in-flight service was good and the 737-800 used was clean and comfortable. NBO-JNB was a different story. Upon arrival at Nairobi Airport I was informed that I had been re-booked on a later flight instead. As a result the boarding process took a long time and the flight was delayed about 30mins. The 767 used on this leg was in good shape with a smart blue leather interior and a good seat pitch. The IFE was a bit dated with the old-style projector. Meal choices were a bit odd for breakfast but the service was prompt.,7/18/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,6
A Crane,1,Blue Islands really do make the customer feel special and not like cattle herded onto a plane. Staff are most courteous and booking online is quick and simple with no hidden charges. Give me Blue Islands airways any day of the week. Just a pity Blue Islands don't fly to Bournemouth from Jersey anymore - but you can't have everything.,11/25/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,10
A Graupe,0,YYC-FRA and back on the two-class 9-abreast 777-300ER. The seat was as comfortable as I've ever had in economy with sufficient legroom for me even in a standard row. Service was hit-or-miss. On the way over we had a very friendly cheerful crew but on the way back the flight attendants were very snappy and unbelievably inconsiderate to passengers that didn't speak English or French. The food was mediocre compared to the meals I got on the connecting FRA-MAD leg on Lufthansa which is sort of disappointing for a 9-hour flight versus a 2 hour flight. The selection of wine was worse than Iberia Regional offered on MAD-GRX no less. It's not a huge deal to me I didn't expect to eat and drink like a king but when you look at what other airlines are offering I can't help but feel embarrassed for my national airline. The IFE system was decent with a good variety of TV shows and movies. Unfortunately the in-flight map didn't work on the return segment but that's a very minor complaint. Overall I was fairly pleased with the experience compared to my previous experience with Air Canada within North America.,5/15/2014,4,4,2,4,2,8
A Crew,1,Easy online check in and as we had no hold baggage a painless process through the airport. Flight left on time and landed a whole hour early. Cabin crew very good completing the service quickly and efficiently Return equally punctual and again good service onboard. Only slight drawback was that the duty free stocks were very limited and none of what we wanted was available - the crew on the way out blamed this on 'end of season'. Surely the stocks should be kept up whatever the time of year it all adds to the airline's profit!,10/30/2013,4,4,4,NaN,4,9
A Greenberg,0,Flight was scheduled to leave at 12.40pm from LIM and go to LAX. At about noon it was announced that the flight was delayed due to technical issues and to return at 2.00pm. At 2.00pm it was announced the issues were not resolved and to come back at 4.00pm. At 4.00pm it was announced that the flight was delayed until 7.00am the next day. Passengers passports were collected to get the exit stamp revoked when passports were handed back 2 hours later it was done in a nerve wrecking fashion. I asked one of the staff if there was another flight that night to Southern California he said no. Later I see someone getting onto standby and I learn there was another flight that night. I waited on standby and did not get a spot. I took the appointed taxi to the hotel I was given to stay at. At the airport I get my new boarding pass. I get to the boarding gate and learned that the flight is delayed again. Throughout the whole process staff would make important announcements only in Spanish. I would ask for a translation and some of the staff were unable to give it. Hours later the flight finally got off the ground. A delayed flight is forgivable but the way the ordeal was handle was unacceptable.,4/7/2014,3,3,3,3,1,NaN
A Crociani,1,FCO-AOI-FCO and FCO-PSA-FCO. The flights to and from Ancona operated with an A319 instead of ATR-72 as scheduled which was too big for such a short route and in fact it was quite empty. On the flights to Pisa Alitalia uses Etihad Regional's ATR-72 that's a very nice and comfortable little aircraft appropriate for this route. Cabin crew professional the food service is pretty much the same used on European flights.,4/23/2015,4,4,3,0,3,7
A Griffiths,1,Brisbane-London flight was great service the best we've had. Stops were no problem food was nice - soft drinks on tap no alcohol rule wasn't a problem. You can buy at the airport and drink onboard - staff will give you ice and mixers but once its open you can't take it through to next stop.,8/26/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
A Crociani,1,22/08/2013 Rome to Amsterdam and return 25/08/2013. All flights on a 321 old but well maintained (the second aircraft was better than the first one). On the FCO-AMS leg we took off about 30 minutes late due to heavy traffic in the airport the flight from AMS to FCO was smooth and we arrived on time. The catering could be better (a pocket of cookies or pretzels and a drink) but was sufficient for a 2 hours flight. No inflight entertainment. Staff professional but a little bit unfriendly. Will fly again.,8/26/2013,4,4,3,0,4,8
A Griggs,1,Flew KUL-BWN and return. Both flights left early due to Ramadan. The outbound flight was 100% full in economy and empty in Business. The crew were friendly and a hot meal was distributed to everyone who wanted one and for those who were fasting a meal box was given to be eaten after sunset. On the return the plane only had 29 passengers on board yet the crew continued their high standards and the flight was very enjoyable.,7/24/2013,4,4,3,3,4,9
A Crociani,1,FCO-OLB-FCO. Meridiana uses the MD80 on this route I think it's a wonderful machine very silent on the front but quite noisy on the back. Cabin crew professional and polite always smiling except one on the return flight that seemed bored and completely uninterested. On the first leg we left FCO on time and we arrived 30 minutes early! the return was on time also. Very satisfied I hope I'll fly them again.,4/27/2015,4,4,3,0,4,8
A Gudmundson,0,"Flight 833 from FLL to Montego Bay Jamaica on 1/15. Flight supposed to be at 10.30 and we left at 4.00. I would recommend that everybody avoid Spirit wherever possible. I've flown them twice and after the first time I said I would never fly them again now I'm kicking myself for not doing that. When comparing their fares to other providers you may be tempted to save a few dollars but trust me it is not worth the headache. Keep in mind that they will be nickel and diming you for everything from baggage to drinks to printing a boarding pass. In my first experience with spirit the flight was delayed 3.5 hrs and we were given no reason. On my second the flight was delayed 5 hours due to ""weather"" from the departing city. When I asked what the departing city was they noted Myrtle Beach SC. Sure enough weather.com shows sunny and delightful all day in Myrtle. Overall I'd say Spirit is not worth the money. Save yourself the frustration.",1/17/2014,1,2,1,1,1,1
A Crow,0,Flew to Bangkok with Thai Airways who were lovely to fly with great choice of food and good leg room. We were expecting at least the same level of comfort and service with BA. The leg room is terrible and only an hour after take off the lady in front put her chair in full recline and made the space in front of me so claustrophobic I couldn't see the TV screen as it was so close to my face as well as having to sit at an awkward position as I have long legs and couldn't put them out in front of me. So uncomfortable. The food was dire with cheap pasta or minuscule fish with more rice After a fortnight of eating rice it would have been nice to have something different. Does BA actually read and take notice of these negative reviews are we wasting our time?,3/17/2015,1,1,1,2,3,1
A Cunningham,1,MEX-HAV-MEX. Excellent experience both journeys. Newish Airbus A320 clean good leg room and in great condition (possibly ex Taca). On time for both trips ( early departure out of Mexico City). Service was great efficient and pleasant also all crew bilingual (Spanish and English). Food absolutely fine (ham and cheese roll muffin etc). Flights were booked direct with Cubana online and no hiccups with e ticket as issued.,6/26/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Guiver,1,VA 43 Brisbane to Bali June 6. Flight delayed by approx 30 minutes due to crewing. Flight 90% full. We were fortunate to have purchased exit row seats so had a reasonable amount of space for the 6+ hour flight. Crew performed well under difficult circumstances (only 2 toilets at rear of the 787-800 - hence long queues and galley at rear of the aircraft). Food average and some beverages ran out. In-flight wifi entertainment adequate Due to the flying time and therefore comfort this route may be better served by VA with a larger aircraft as Jetstar now operates the 787 to this destination out of Brisbane.,6/20/2014,4,4,4,4,3,7
A Cusack,0,Gatwick-Madrid-Caracas. Overall not very pleasant but if you really need to save the difference in fare go for it. Pre-departure communication is very poor regarding e-tickets check-in etc. Checking in I had no problems having arrived about 1.45 before flight. Gatwick-Madrid was delayed nearly two hours.As a result I had to charge through Madrid airport to my gate where the connection to Caracas was waiting replete with angry Venezuelans. I found the staff very pleasant and accommodating and their English was very good. Food was bad worse than usual. The planes are in a bit of a state with reclining chairs needing to be manually pulled back into upright position that kind of thing. No problems with baggage. Overall I would probably have preferred to pay slightly more for TAP (Portugal) or another established airline.,9/8/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,4
A Gurevich,0,"10 April 2015 Airbus A320 Business Heathrow to Rome FCO. A total waste of money. The food was ""tea"" there was no entertainment system and the only difference I could find from premium coach or regular coach was that the middle seat was empty and a portable table was placed between the arm rests. As alcoholic beverages are provided for all classes there's nothing to be gained there the seat pitch was pathetic and aside from having the middle seat empty the only benefit to be had was boarding and de-planing first. Don't waste your money unless someone else is paying for it.",4/17/2015,1,1,1,1,2,3
A D Storey,1,AA51 LHR - DFW in new 773. American have hit the bullseye! Excellent service and food from the crew. AVOD system has more movies than you can look at! The seat is extremely comfortable. Inflight bar area is a nice place to stretch and have a chat. Definitely look to fly on this plane again.,9/6/2014,5,5,4,5,5,9
A Guthrie,1,Flew from Toronto to Glasgow on Jan 09 returning Jan 24. Online booking and check-in was flawless but no online check in for return flight from Glasgow. Schedule was well met in both cases and meals were as good as you would expect to get on any airline indeed much better than some of the majors we have flown on. Both aircraft were clean and comfortable enough for a transatlantic flight. With one exception concerning car rental through AirTransat which I will deal with directly everything was perfectly acceptable and value for monies paid.,1/28/2013,4,3,4,3,4,8
A H Ashiblie,1,KUL-TPE (21 Feb MH408) and TPE-KUL (28 Feb MH367) with B738. Excellent service by very professional crew on both flights. Excellent food (especially the satay) and wine. Seats definitely comfortable for the 4 hour flight. The Purser on the TPE-KUL flight surprised me with a gift (being a One World Platinum). I look forward to flying MH again.,3/17/2015,5,5,5,5,5,10
A D Storey,1,LAX-HNL-AKL. New A330 aircraft on both legs. Seat is very comfortable and sufficient for the length of flights. (Not a sleeper seat). Crew were excellent. Food and wine choices also very good. Would definitely fly them again.,2/18/2015,5,4,4,4,5,9
A Hait,0,Fully satisfied in the past however my last two trips were awful. Since Air Asia introduced web check-in the problem has started. My flight was to Chennai I did web check-in and arrived 2.5 hours early for baggage drop off. However the baggage drop off area was total chaos! People were cutting in between the lines without any respect for the queue. I waited in line for almost 2 hours without moving. 40 mins before departure two new counters opened for Chennai only and I managed to get my luggage dropped off 20 mins before departure. Ran for immigration but my expatriate gold card helped me pass through quickly and I boarded the flight 5 mins before departure. This has now happened to me a few times in the past when there was separate check-in counters there were no issue.,1/13/2012,1,3,4,0,2,4
A da Silva,0,"Customer service is awful. Their website doesn't work for me to book online so I had to call customer service. Apparently only 1 person speaks English there and even so not well which made the phone call I had to pay for even more expensive. I had to call to book because ""their"" site wasn't working. On top of paying for the phone call I had to pay 10â‚¬ to book over the phone! The rep gave me a 20â‚¬ voucher for the next booking which I must make over the phone putting me in the same situation again. Not worth the hassle. Trip was fine though plane had not been cleaned.",7/21/2010,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,7
A Hall,0,Flew Sydney-HMC-London in September (inflight entertainment did not work). Returned in November (inflight entertainment did not work) seemed like this was pretty normal as none of the cabin crew seemed surprised. Wife became ill on the flight and noticing that there were very few in business class I asked if she could be moved to get some fresher air (just until she felt better) I was given an abrupt 'these seats are only for business class passengers'.,12/19/2012,1,3,3,1,1,NaN

A Halliwell,1,YGN-PNH (via REP). Flight was almost full. Meal service on YGN-REP sector - decent meal and drinks service. No IFE but the Mingalabar magazine was interesting enough. Transit in REP was fine straight through to the international departure hall which has a range of shops and internet access. Second leg much shorter although a drinks run was provided. Lounge access at YGN ($8) is total worth the cost. Flights on time crew friendly.,4/1/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Darwish,1,Gold Coast to KL return. Seats are comfortable. Meals adequate and I that I could order munchies or drinks at a very decent price when I wanted. Only issue I have is that I was told I could hire an entertainment unit on board but they only had 10 and were all taken. Told to book online but no where was there a link. Other than that both legs were enjoyable and service top quality.,10/9/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8

A Hamilton,0,Dublin - Izmir / Izmir - Dublin. 3rd - 17th Aug. Turkish version of Ryanair! Very cramped seating. Hot stuffy plane. Extremely rude cabin crew. Accepted a currency from me for a cup of tea and came back 10 mins later telling me I lied about the currency - sterling issued by The Bank of Ireland apparently isn't accepted. I explained that I only had that money with me - spent the next 2 hours of dirty looks and muttering stuff. Seat covers coming off half the seats. Incoherent announcements on flight heavily accented and sound of speaker was too hard to understand what was being said. Seats tilt back so far that if you don't have your seat tilted back you have about 5 inches to yourself. Food and drink selection poor and price very expensive 4 euro for cup of tea and 3 euro for water. Never again!,8/21/2013,1,1,2,1,1,NaN

A Hans,0,LHR-NRT-LHR. Staff were helpful on outward journey always around to to help. At the inbound it wasn't the case. They looked tired lacking of sleep and seem to disappear for prolonged periods! Food excellent for special meal. The rest no different than other airlines and short of JAL. Online booking facility a bit outdated. Seat selection facility in flash always crashing. The worst with ANA there is no area to leave feedback online no proper call centre with extended hours. Basically if you miss 17:30 you are stuffed. I find it very absurd especially that they operate in other countries with different time zones to be able to offer 24h telephone support! If you encounter problems paying online then there is no other way to pay via phone. If you are impatient please look for other airlines.,1/28/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,6
A Davidson,0,"Flight 3001 - Las Palmas (LPA) to Barcelona (BCN) on Feb 16th 2014: Overhead bins directly above seats in rows 2 and 3 not available for those of us seated in these seats but reserved for guests seated in row 1 - regardless of whether or not there is anyone seated in that row. The very first overhead bin is obviously reserved for crew luggage which apparently takes precedence over paying passengers carry on luggage. Seats in 2a and 2c as well as in 3 f occupied by Vueling employees traveling from LPA back to BCN - along with the dog accompanying the two seated directly in front of us in row 2. Following take off all 3 of the above mentioned ""passengers"" disappeared behind the closed curtain into the forward galley area where they remained throughout the flight up to the landing announcement being made. The above mentioned dog did not remain under the seat where it should have been but had also disappeared into the forward galley area. There was absolutely no sign of a flight attendant following take- off from Las Palmas until nearly 2 hours into the flight. At this point we finally managed to get some service from the two young female attendants who were positioned at the rear of the aircraft who were not part of the ""party"" up front. There was no coffee tea or soft drinks being served to those of us in the forward portion of the cabin. Iberia was bad enough but this airline is even worse and we would not recommend them to anyone if they can at all avoid flying with Vueling. Our mistake was taking a chance on Iberia's subsidiary in order to give Iberia another chance. We now know we made a poor choice.",2/17/2014,3,1,2,5,1,NaN
A Hansen-Weil,0,If you have to fly with someone don't fly with AA. They made me check in my carry on luggage and were unable to open the undercarriage door making me miss my connector flight to Atlanta. I had to stay overnight in Chicago due to their failure. I asked two different employees for a Supervisor and both of them told me there wasn't one. I had to go to a different airline and they got me an AA supervisor. The own AA employees outright lied to me about a supervisor. They scheduled me on a 6am flight the next morning and yet again they had issues. They had defuelling issues on the plane and everyone had to deboard. They are now trying to get us on a different plane. Do not fly with this company unless you want to pay a lot of money for a ticket to arrive a day later and potentially lose your luggage. Worst airline I've ever used so far.,4/22/2014,1,1,1,1,1,1

We have flown Allegiant Air at least 5 times and ignored a problem or two because it was cheap. Usually there was an hour or two delay. One time there were no attendants at the counter and when it was time to board all passengers boarded. An Allegiant employee came aboard and in a very nasty tone threatened to have us all arrested.

A Davies,0,Like the review from T Moss - 14 Jan we also used this flight from Hurghada to Manchester on 1st Feb with Monarch using an A321 a plane with the least capability for the distance needed or fuel capacity if headwinds are encountered - why is this allowed to happen. On the outward flight we were seated in cattle class at the back with legroom fit for a dwarf like Mr Moss the cabin crew came round with hot drinks etc without being informed there was a hot meal being provided later luckily we had a hot drink/snack because I could not fold my tray down because of the lack of room. Coming home we booked seats at the front with extra legroom. On arrival at Hurghada airport we were all given a letter telling us we were being diverted to Rome as the plane would encounter very strong headwinds and was incapable of holding enough fuel to get us back to the UK. Had a good flight up to Rome just over 4 hrs with a nice meal on a tray that we were able to fold down with comfort - paying Â£40 a couple for the extra legroom. Then informed by the captain that once we landed in Rome there was a standby crew that had been flown from Gatwick waiting for us - Monarch must have known well in advance this was going to happen. Less than 30 mins later we all got back on - the new captain then informed us we would have to get off again because there had been a mess up with the amount of fuel. Eventually got home at 3am.,2/5/2013,1,1,4,1,3,NaN
A Harnett,1,I've been negligent in writing this review. I reviewed Finnair about three months ago and gave them a terrible rating which was true of my experience at that time. This flight was already booked otherwise there was no way I'd have flown them again which was very fortunate for me. The equipment was their new airbus and made all the difference. This was an excellent experience and compares with prior ones that I've had with Finnair. I'm happy to report that they deserve their 4 star rating. In my prior review I would not have given them a three. I flew Bangkok to Helsinki and then on to Madrid return in business class. I would recommend them highly and especially so with their excellent pricing. The seat was a little tight. I found it somewhat difficult to to get up for breaks. Definitely tight. I'm 5'10 and of below average weight. Other that that a very great experience I'm happy to report.,1/11/2015,5,4,5,4,5,10
A Davis,0,Recently returned from a trip to Thailand and had an awful experience with China Eastern Airlines (JFK-PVG-BKK). Before the trip: I spent hours on the phone trying to get hold of a representative to get a seat assignment. No luck. On the outbound segment I missed my connection in JFK (due to a delay from my home city) and could not find a CEA representative anywhere in the terminal. After hours on the phone I was rebooked to a flight the next day. Once I arrived in Shanghai I learned that my flight was cancelled (due to weather not the airlines fault) but the airline could not provide any assistance. A mob of passengers flocked the gate agent. Finally the flight was reinstated for 2.30am but again there was no clear communication and no guaranteed rebooking. In sum total chaos and no help from the airline.,7/1/2013,2,3,2,1,3,2
A Harris,1,PEK-FNJ-PEK in business class on new Tu-204. The seats were quite spacious and airplane comfortable. I thought it really odd that they served a huge meal PEK-FNJ but only bread on the return. The flight attendants were decent enough though English skills were lacking. There was access to the Air China lounge at PEK T2. I didn't visit the lounge on the return at FNJ. On the flight PEK-FNJ there were no more seats so a North Korean teenager sat in the flight attendant jump seat for the whole flight. On the way back the security guard sat in the flight attendant jump seat and she sort of sat on the very edge of the same jump seat and held the wall for take off and landing. They also kept the curtains closed to the front of the aircraft which in the event of an evacuation would be a no-no because people couldn't see to get to the exit.,10/9/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,5
A Daynes,0,As per the previous review I was traveling on the cancelled 2345 flight from Nairobi to Heathrow as part of a round trip. The flights in both directions were reasonably good the entertainment systems were broken for most of the seats but staff were pleasant and helpful and food was good. Unfortunately the reaction to the cancelled flight was awful and the worst treatment I have ever received from an airline. As the previous reviewer says the staff were very slow extremely ill informed and seem to have lied on occasion. Almost no effort was made to inform passengers as to what they needed to do in terms of changing flights getting back through immigration control and sorting out a hotel. This resulted in a great deal of frustration and wasted time queuing in the wrong places. In particular the airline made very little effort to help passengers find hotel accommodation; only one member of staff was available to help and passengers including us were told that there was no hotel accommodation left available which was later proved to be untrue when a number of passengers complained and were miraculously found hotel rooms. I suspect the lack of hotel rooms may have related rather more to a lack of appetite to pay the room rates rather than any genuine shortage. Ultimately we along with perhaps a third of the passengers ended up sleeping on the floor of the transit lounge until we were told to get up and move at around 6am. The re-scheduled flight was then further delayed when the first officer did not turn up for work at this point refreshments were provided but not enough for all the passengers. All in all a consistent and depressing display of incompetence.,10/23/2011,2,3,2,1,2,2
A Harvey,1,LGW-RAK-LGW and as ever an excellent experience with a polished airline that some people still love to slate normally because they don't bother to read the T&C's of travel! Outbound on a clean A320 with great crew left on time and arrive 30 mins early. Coming home an A319 which left 10 mins late but still arrived 15 mins ahead of schedule. Allocated seating GREAT and crew again happy and attentive. I think easyJet are still way ahead of the game even compared to holy grail of BA! Reading other peoples negative reviews makes me laugh because they haven't read their terms and conditions of travel - that's hardly easyJets fault! Great airline great service and normally great crew - and always at a great price.,5/19/2013,5,5,4,NaN,5,9

A De Lorenzo,0,This airline is now black listed on our travels. We were not allowed on the flight due to over booking. There were 4 of us travelling and seats were scattered over the plane. I was not allowed to sit with my wife The vegetarian meal that was ordered at booking and confirmed 5 times at check in even by the airport manager was not loaded. Staff promised compensation but withdrew the offer after the flight had left and we were stranded.

A Hein,0,We travel each year to St Lucia and booked Premium Economy both ways this time. Previously we had seats upstairs in the 'bubble' but with the new aircraft on this route this is not available. The new arrangements are not a patch on the previous ones. Apart from the main cabin being much less quiet and peaceful the seats are less comfortable and the storage facilities very basic. It will be BA next year.,3/5/2014,3,2,2,4,4,6
A Debnath,0,DEL-IXU via Bhubaneshwar. Both flights were on time on a CRJ 700. Naturally comfort factor comes down to zero. No IFE and almost nil leg space. Seats are cramped and offer almost no push back. Meals were served well and decent keeping in mind that airlines in India are all trying to do away with the catering concept entirely. The ticket prices are quite stiff for this route and yet there is no business class on this aircraft. Its a small plane that can accommodate only 70 passengers. I have been flying Air India for a while but this experience will make me think before buying a ticket for another flight. When you are flying for 4 hours and paying a high price you certainly wish for a comfortable journey.,1/1/2012,2,1,3,0,2,4
A Henry,0,Luton to Belfast International. I paid extra to pick my seat. There was a biting cold wind with gusts to 50mph. Boarding was really slow so I got to stand around on open steps for several minutes whilst people got their stuff packed. When I got on board my carefully chosen window seat turned out to be next to a screaming baby. I swapped with one of the parents so I was then one row away from a screaming baby. On a flight with unallocated seating I would have picked a seat 15 rows away. The next time I flew with them they made me pack my carry on bag in the hold. There were seats which were near empty luggage bins but the bins near my allocated seat were full. It meant I had to hang around waiting for my bag to arrive when I should have been on my way home. They are trying to act like a premium airline but without the infrastructure or the organisation. It takes too long to board so they end up running late. If I'm boarding from a sky bridge then its not so bad to have to wait whilst people find a specific seat. However with Easyjet if I am queuing outside I want everyone onboard and seated as soon as possible. When I've got a choice I will use some other airline.,5/13/2013,3,3,0,NaN,2,2
A Del,0,Very bad experience! Flying London to Bangalore via Mumbai return via Delhi. Travelling with 10 month old no consideration from crew. Worst customer service delayed connecting flights long waiting times (45 min after arrival stuck onboard before being allowed to leave - 30 mins before stroller was handed back and another 45 mins before luggage arrived). Staff attitude was unfriendly unhelpful and inefficient.,4/21/2012,3,3,3,3,1,2
A Hibbert,0,Friday night flight from Glasgow to London Gatwick. We arrived at 18.00 for the flight as we had to drive in from northern Scotland. Flight was supposed to depart at 21.20 and land at 22.45 after which we would get some sleep in a hotel and fly out to Tenerife at 05.50 the next morning. At check-in we were advised of a delay of 1 hour 38 minutes with no explanation but the agent told us to keep watching the board as easyJet would try to push the flight forward. The opposite happened. Our scheduled departure time went past 23.00 00.00 and 01.00. Eventually a fellow passenger told us that refreshment vouchers were being handed out at the gate but no announcements were being made to that effect. Staff at the airport were visibly annoyed at the situation. There were no easyJet representatives to speak to only gate staff. When they finally did appear they told us that the delay to the inbound flight was due to severe thunderstorms in Gatwick earlier on in the day but every flight before and after it had already left Gatwick so clearly something else was wrong. They eventually told us that the aircraft was now fully boarded in Gatwick and was awaiting one more crew member they would inform us of its departure. The aircraft landed at 01.50 and we were called forward for boarding immediately leaving us standing for 10 minutes - not what we wanted having been awake since 05.00 the previous morning. Boarded just after 02.00 and took off at 02.25. The captain explained that the delay was due to thunderstorms but in addition the aircraft had technical problems forcing a replacement aircraft to be found and a new crew also had to be sourced. We were in the last row of the aircraft which had no window and was cramped due to the tapering in of the fuselage at the rear. This in addition to the annoying racket the cabin crew were making in the galley made sleep almost impossible. It was 03.45 by the time we disembarked in Gatwick check in for our next flight was already open. To our horror the aircraft parked at the South terminal (replacement aircraft had next flight from there) meaning that passengers and baggage had to be taken over to the North terminal where the flight was destined. Fortunately baggage arrived quickly which was a huge relief because we had to change back to the South terminal in time for our next flight where we finally arrived absolutely exhausted at 04.15. To top it all off easyJet sent us an email saying that the delay was due to adverse weather alone and so we are not entitled to compensation.,11/12/2014,2,2,0,NaN,2,2
A Delft,1,We used Arkefly twice this year departing from Amsterdam: once to Curacao return and once to Antalya Turkey return. Out of the 4 flights 3 were great and one really bad. The intercontinental flights and one flight AMS-Antalya: enough space in the airplane friendly staff and service quite good (despite the plane being 100% full on both flights). Limited choice Inflight Entertainment (IFE) but one could find something to watch. Food usual plane stuff one meal free extras with payment. Departure times perfectly respected smooth landing. No complaints. We flew comfort class. We loved the facility of being able to check in our luggage from the long term parking building. Brilliant idea thank you. No waiting lines no carrying luggage to the departure desk. Last flight Antalya-AMS: not enough leg space tiniest airplane ever we flew packed. No food or drinks for free. NO IFE. Departure times respected. All in all: would fly again intercontinental would hesitate a bit for short distance flights.,8/7/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Delphin,0,"A party of 9 family members flew from several locations around the US to Rome and Italy for a vacation. 4 of the members flew back from Rome to the US yesterday on Alitalia. The 4 who flew Alitalia were disappointed with the level of service on the plane. Meals were noticeably sub-par when compared to the service 2 weeks earlier on other carriers and the service provided by the carriers flown by other members of the family. Surprised at the announcement 4 hours before landing that ""drinks and snacks are available at the rear of the plane."" We also noticed that the staff made one sweep of the cabin collecting food containers. Anything after that was not picked up. As we deplaned the plane looked like a park after a rock concert: paper napkins cups and wrappers everywhere. The cloth seat covers were soiled and in poor condition. The only good thing I can say is that the pilots did an excellent job. Flight and landing were smooth.",7/23/2013,2,3,2,3,2,3
A Hickling,1,LHR-DME on 19 July seat 1A Club World. I flew on one of the converted A321 jets that BMI used to own and was very impressed with the seat. The configuration is 1 and 2 seats and if you're travelling alone the single seat is great to have. There is lots of space to place items and the seat has different positions from arm chair to fully flat bed. The seat also has a built in massage function. The TV screen was 15 inches in size and operated from a remote in the seat. The service was excellent from two male crew members and the food and wine selection was of a high standard.,7/29/2014,5,5,4,4,5,9
A Denisov,1,Moscow to Hurghada Monastir and Antalya. All flights were on B747 old ones but well maintained. No delays smooth and efficient check-in. Business Class Lounge in Domodedovo was pretty comfortable. Seats were huge (as the aircraft's were previously with some Japanese airlines they kept what was First Class and offer it as Business). Cabin crew were courteous and efficient. Meal was excellent generous portions with a good selection but the main thing was the quality of food was of a high standard.,9/13/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,10

A Hijmans,0,SSA-BSB-SSA. Both legs in 737-800. Outbound flight on time inbound flight delayed for half an hour in BSB waiting for a connecting flight to arrive. Arrival in SSA nearly on time though. Aircraft spotlessly clean on both legs two drinks and aforementioned cereal bars served with a smile (IFAs will give you extra cereal bars if you ask.) Check-in staff extremely helpful and friendly. Just three stars though due to the fact that the seats in the 737-800s are rock hard even if their pitch is good for a low-cost airline.,4/30/2008,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,3
A Descrieres,1,CDG-KBP-LWO and back. All flights departed on time. International sectors operated by B-737/800/900 with adequate legroom. Domestic sectors operated by B-737/500 with more generous pitch. No flight entertainment but its not really needed on short flights and if I want to watch a movie I will buy a cinema ticket rather than an airline ticket. On international flights only water is offered free while on domestic flights you have a choice of coffee or water free. Altogether UIA fulfils its mission that is to carry passengers and their luggage safely and on time at a very reasonable fare.,3/4/2015,4,3,0,0,4,8
A Hindle,0,We were booked from Heathrow to Lanzarote. The schedule was changed 6 times and eventually all but one connecting flight were cancelled. Iberia were unable to get us to Madrid in time to catch the connecting flight. We were left high and dry and eventually flew out on the previous evening to Madrid booking our own hotel. Iberia couldn't care less and offered no help or explanation. Just to add insult to injury they use an 0870 number so it cost every time I called them.,2/28/2013,1,3,0,0,1,NaN
A Dewey,0,"US Airways itself was not too bad. The problem was the smaller airlines they contract to. Boston to DC (Reagan) - not too bad was on time at least. DC to Chicago - delayed but no idea why. Sat in Chicago for 2 hours boarded deplaned boarded again - they ""couldn't find the pilot"". Finally got to Des Moines. Two days later Des Moines to Charlotte - delayed no idea why. While waiting for my carry-on to be retrieved from ""valet checking"" so I could make my connection to Philadelphia the gate attendant was quite rude when I asked the status of my connection. Ran through the airport to make the connection then sat on the plane for 30 minutes. Was also told that I would need to check my carry-on because there was ""no room"" in the overhead compartment. When I boarded most of the overhead compartments were open - several were empty most were less than half full. Had to collect bag from baggage claim when I got to Philadelphia but at least I didn't have to pay for it. Philadelphia to Boston was slightly delayed because of a check engine light that came on after we were all boarded. They did manage to get maintenance in fairly quickly and apparently got the problem resolved - but this was US Air not a smaller airline. I'm going back to Southwest and Jet Blue - cheaper more reliable more customer oriented and they keep better track of their pilots.",8/5/2013,2,1,0,0,2,3
A Hodder,1,"I travelled late August 2014 on Flight TCX 724 Manchester to Las Vegas and was apprehensive about the flight having read no many negative reviews beforehand. It seems to me that your luck is down to the aircraft you fly on. The Premium cabin extra legroom is definitely worth it as we travelled back with Virgin en Economy which was far worse. All the complaints seem to be petty (films on loops no free drinks person in front reclined seat). We really enjoyed the flight and glad I did my research before hand and was prepared with my own drinks and my own films on tablet. Not difficult really. Food was excellent but I'm sure James Martin did not prepare it himself as it seems some of the reviewers wanted! Cabin crew where helpful and polite and no different to Virgin Staff. Word of warning on hand luggage - 6 Kgs only so make use of the 23 Kgs in the hold. Overall I say ""hats off"" to Thomas Cook for offering an alternative to Virgin with no frills and making everything very clear on their website including the information on cost for drinks. I will certainly be paying half price compared to Virgin and fly with TC again. I understand that next year the food will be included in the ticket price and some beverages. I just hope they don't hike the prices up!",9/6/2014,5,4,5,3,4,9

A Hollick,0,"Flight was $200 compared to an average of $250 for other carriers. Got to gate and was told my ""one and only"" carry on bag (that fits in the overhead compartment) was too large to qualify and would cost me $100 round trip. That's 50% of the total flight charge. Had no choice as I was already at the airport. Got on plane. Charged $2.50 for a coffee. Lady next to me was also charged for a blanket. I will never fly this airline again. Seat was cramped and uncomfortable.",11/25/2014,1,1,1,1,1,1
A Difiori,1,Flight SQ317 (LHR-SIN) on 30th November 2013 seat 27K on upper deck. Check-in was fast although I understand that one of the check-in assistants was rude to my colleague by suggesting it was obvious he'd not flown business class before but hey we were in England and you can't complain about poor service here. The flight itself was fine. I had used BTC for the food. The only let down was the breakfast which was bizarre. I had pre-ordered multigrain toast after a few mis-understandings on what it came with I decided to stay with this choice however I wish I had not. It consisted of 2 pieces of what was more like chipboard than toast accompanied by grilled asparagus carrots aubergine and courgettes and on the same place was a sweet pastry. Not sure who makes up the dishes but this certain was not complimentary to each other. All the veg were dry and chewy. Having usually flown Virgin business class in the past I was used to having my bed made for me but this does not happen in SIA flights also the bed even though lay flat was designed in a way that for me at 6ft2 was very uncomfortable. Overall not a bad experience just some oddities.,12/7/2013,4,3,3,5,4,8
A Hornbuckle,0,BNE-ICH-IST return LHR-ICH-BNE. Outward journey in October return in November. On very long flights surely inflight entertainment could be rotated. Same applies to the Menus - same on all flights east or west makes no difference. Cabin staff have a poor understanding of English - they didn't seem to be a staff member that could speak fluent English. All attendants seem obsessed with was serving food and getting the shutters down as soon as possible. When I board a day flight I do not want to sit in the dark for the next 10 hours. Other than the leg room advantage in Business class I feel it is a lot of money to pay for the privilege. Even the standard of Airport lounges have been downgraded.,11/16/2011,3,4,2,1,3,6
A Dine,1,I flew from Bournemouth 22/09/14 to Carcassonne and returned 26/09/14.

A Huang,1,Beijing (PEK) - San Francisco (SFO). Aircraft was a 15 year old 747. Cabin amenities were showing their age. Seats were the new kind and were quite comfy and could recline well.

A Dobson,0,Booked over 6 months in advance for our tickets from Singapore to Koh Samui. This was the first flight with Silk Air and possibly the last. Food was very ordinary on the flight to Samui. We didn't eat it. Flight was okay apart from that but return flight was very poor. Despite booking together and being husband and wife we were placed in separate seats to make matters worse at the rear near the toilets. Admittedly it was a busy flight but the staff didn't seem to care. 'It's only a 1.5 hour flight' was the response when I asked if we could move to seats together. The food was better than on the way over but we felt like we were travelling with a very average budget airline even though we paid a premium price. Will avoid travelling with Silk Air again.,12/13/2012,1,3,2,1,2,2
A Huggett,1,Having previously experienced delays and cancellations with Jetstar I was curious to see how this flight would be. Overall it was very good. I paid $39 for Sydney to Melbourne (Avalon) and it was money well spent considering the alternative flights at the same time with other airlines to Melbourne (Tullamarine) were much more expensive. The flight was a good example of what a LCC should be. On time departure and arrival friendly crew a clean A320 and surprisingly comfortable seats. I am 180cm and my knees were not touching the seat in front perhaps due to the clever re-positioning of the magazine pocket to the top of the seat-back above the meal tray. I would fly Jetstar again if the price is right.,8/15/2013,5,4,0,0,4,9
A Domican,1,Flight BA72 and BA73. Departed 14th May returned 20th May 2015. Very impressed with flight and cabin service on our trip from Dublin to Muscat Oman both in Club Europe and Club World.

A Huggett,1,"Sydney-Hobart-Sydney on 737-800 and E190. A mixed bag. I can't quite figure out VA. Aircraft's are modern and the refurbished interior including seats look and feel great. Plenty of legroom. The 737 had the old ""live2air"" seatback entertainment. The E190 had no entertainment. Food was only available to purchase on these flights but if I was travelling from Sydney to Canberra or within WA some snacks are complimentary. My return flight departed on a Tuesday at 5pm and beer and wine are offered complimentary between 4pm and 7pm - but only between mainland capitol cities. Overall I don't mind flying VA but it would be good if they could create some consistency in their product.",2/21/2013,3,5,1,1,3,7
A Donlan,0,Amman to Amsterdam Jan 2012. Flight should have taken 5 hrs - took over 17 hrs. Firstly 2 hour delay in Amman due to fog - no explanation given until we were in the air and no drinks given. We tried to land in Amsterdam at midday but due to high winds we diverted to Hamburg. In Hamburg we were not allowed to leave the plane or get any food or drink. Eventually got off the plane - immigration were unaware of who we were and a further delay was caused here. Before we left the plane the crew told all passengers that a representative from the airline would meet us in Hamburg - nobody met us and nobody knew where to go. We were told food and drink would be available for the passengers - this did not happen and each passenger had to pay for their own food and drink. We eventually left Hamburg after searching for the bus and arrived in Schiphol Airport Amsterdam after midnight All in all a terrible experience that I never want to repeat.,1/11/2012,1,4,1,4,1,3
A Hussein,0,London Heathrow - Kuala Lumpur 12 April on MH 003. The Malaysian airlines first class is not as impressive in comparison to other first class A380's out there on the market. It lacked style and good cabin ambience. It felt like MAS simply had to put a first class in for the sake of it and didn't really think through the idea. I've thought that MAS was the leading carrier in south east asia and hope that it will redesign its first class cabin. It such a shame with an amazing aircraft like the A380 that the first class product is simply mediocre.,4/14/2014,2,4,3,2,4,5

A Douas,1,ATH-SAW-ESB. Pegasus is half the price of THY for this route so I prefer flying for them for 2 flights that last no more than 1 hour each. Since the flight is so short I never bother with the overpriced food and drink. Seats are fine flight attendants don't bother you unless necessary for safety or if you want something to eat. 20 kg free luggage allowance is better than most legacy carriers!

A Huynh,1,"SGN-SIN and SIN-SGN. Flight to Singapore was 1 hr late. The seat back pockets were filled with rubbish and the floors of the aircraft were filthy. Flight attendants were nice for most part but it seemed like their only responsibility were to sell drinks/food and duty free items. The budget terminal in Singapore seemed ""too low cost"" since seats weren't provided at the gate. Other than that the flights were good for their value.",12/12/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,4
A Draper,0,Travelled to Cancun from Manchester on 28th January 2015. Several weeks prior to travel we were contacted by TC Airlines to be informed that the newly refurbished aircraft would be unavailable for this outbound flight no personal seat back screens but overhead screens instead and less leg room. A refund of Â£25 was given. Another week later another call the same happened for the inbound flight. The aircraft was quite shabby seat backs wonky causing trays not to be level. in-flight entertainment dismal that's when you could see a screen that worked correctly (PC tablets a must for own entertainment). Food was reasonable. The reason for booking with TC was the direct flights and the newly refurbished aircraft. Having travelled previously with Thomas Cook to the Canary Islands I was reluctant to travel long haul with them well next time I will travel non-direct just to avoid this pathetic excuse of an airline.,3/4/2015,2,2,4,1,3,4
A Iqbal,0,Traveled from Geneva to Islamabad via Jeddah. The quality of service varied a lot between the two legs. GVA to JED was small plane (A320) the plane was clean and plenty of legroom. Food was good. Service was overall OK. The second leg was on new 777. The staff was rude and impolite. I was given a seat in business class along with few other passengers. Before departures one of the cabin attended ordered all the passengers to leave business section and find a seat in economy. When I objected they let me stay where I was. Staff was not interested in working at all. I will never fly this airline again ever.,1/10/2014,3,3,3,2,1,3

With the exception of check-in staff who were outsourced all other UL staff were pleasant and friendly both in the air and in Colombo. The food was delicious and drinks were proactively offered. IFE on SIN-CMB was basic but did the job. The SIN-CMB sector makes a 1 hour stop in CMB which is difficult to discern from the booking process.,12/13/2011,5,4,4,4,5,9
A J Hailstone,1,My wife and I fly regularly from Luton to Nimes France we are pleased to get some cheap flights and the journey is not long and we are o/k with the plane and crew but why at Luton do the staff or authorities check our passports and boarding passes and send us outside the departure lounge to wait for the plane to be ready in all sorts of rotten weather under a flimsy open canopy.,10/22/2014,4,3,0,NaN,4,8
A Dron,1,Heathrow - Jeddah - Riyadh - Heathrow. Check-in at LHR for lunchtime departure was instant - no queue. Boeing 777 2x5x2 seating. Comfortable seats decent legroom economy about half- full. Newspapers offered (mainly Arabic) followed by soft drinks. Typical airline food. Seatback screen but not AVOD - system had to be re-set twice by cabin crew early on but otherwise no problems. Flight smooth with the exception of a couple of Arab children running repeatedly up the aisles - fairly normal on MidEast airlines where parents rarely discipline their offspring. Major stroke of luck on arrival at Jeddah as I was attending a conference for which Saudia was handling many of the arrangements so whisked through VIP lounge passport stamped and into a taxi within 20 minutes of getting off aircraft. Jeddah-Riyadh again a 777 an 80-minute hop. Aircraft packed which made the serving of a full breakfast particularly impressive : full marks to the cabin crew. Not a lot of smiles from them but understandable when concentrating on serving 300 people in such a short time. Riyadh-LHR another 777 but this time 10-abreast (3-4-3) and seats noticeably thinner and less comfortable. Felt as though there was around an inch less legroom too which made an appreciable difference. Cabin crew helpful: one FA volunteered that my seatback screen was not working and offered to re-seat me. Only problem was again children running around and one little girl was actually standing on her seat as take-off started. Toilets acceptable. In all a series of flights I would rate as better than average and around 30% cheaper than British Airways.,10/23/2009,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,7
A Jackson,1,SIN-USM one way. Blown away with the service on this airline; 1 hour flight but full dinner served with complimentary wine and additional drinks round.

A Jacob,0,SYD- LAX was ok. Seat was uncomfortable food disappointing (I'm not a fussy eater when it comes to airplane food). LAX to SYD very disappointing! Once again the food was poor. My seat would not recline back. I asked one of the attendants to look into it but she never came back to assist or offer to move me in another seat - on the way to the toilets found a person who had 3 seats all to himself. So the entire 14 hour flight my seat was reclined up while the seat in front of me was reclined forward. Very uncomfortable! In addition my blanket wrapped in plastic was dirty. I think V Australia is focussed too much on giving a 'cool' impression to their customers. But really they should focus on serving the needs of their customers.,3/31/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,3
A Dubiella,1,CMB-FRA UL553 21 April Business Class. Smooth Check-in at Silk Line Route Departure Area especially for Business Class Passengers. Comfortable Serendib Lounge with a lot of hot food and many alcoholic and non alcoholic beverage offerings. Bus Gate with late Boarding for Business Passengers. Onboard: the new Flat Bed was announced it was an Old Style Business Class maybe ex BMI Aircraft with roomy comfortable Business Seats but with a dirty old look. Terrible non AVOD TV and Audio Program and not the promised full flat seat. Very good first class style dinner and breakfast. 4 flight attendants have to serve a maximum of 18 seats but no one knows what the other one is doing. They walk back to the galley for every single plate and glass which is very confusing for them and the passengers. Anyway very friendly crew and excellent meals served. 30 minutes late departure in Colombo 20 minutes late arrival in Frankfurt. Good Value for Money and if they offer the new Flat Bed soon I will fly again with them.,4/23/2013,4,4,5,2,4,8
A Jake,1,We had flights from Bangkok to HCMC and from HCMC to the Gold Coast via KL. All flights left and arrived on time which was excellent.

A Duell,0,I flew UA from New York to LA and had to buy $10 headphones if I wanted to watch the TV. I also booked the flights with my partner and put us seated together and when we printed out our boarding tickets they had moved us so we sat separately on the flight. We then flew from LAX to Sydney Australia. Once again they had separated us. We were extremely annoyed that we had to spend a 14 and a half hour flight sitting in between strangers when we booked to sit together. There was no complimentary alcoholic beverages and the good food always ran out by the time it got towards the end of the plane which a lot of people complained about to the staff. Overall I would never recommend UA to anyone. Splitting up couples and putting single riders between them is a joke and not good enough.,1/11/2015,1,1,1,2,1,2
A Jalandoni,1,BUR-SFO. I flew First Class on a new CRJ-700 with excellent service. Flight crew professional and friendly. New seats on the CRJ very comfortable.

This flight exceeded my expectations for a regional flight. Returning was equally as good.,8/10/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
A Dunnebecke,0,Flying from Phoenix to Denver. Frontier has all these rules about when passengers need to check in but it is ok to make us wait 15-20 minutes to check our bags. The staff come sauntering down to the ticket counter no apologies and no welcomes. My husband and I were the first ones there had checked in and reprinted our boarding passes and ready to go. Did a ticket agent ask who was there first. Of course not and then we ended up waiting while they dealt with six groups before we were taken care of. When I said we were there first I got the evil eye and then had to wait until the agent got to us and deal with her snarky attitude. I swear that cost us even more time. When I tried to call customer service the edit time is 35 minutes. Guess I am not the only one with issues. I have 200k miles in my frequent flyer program. Guess I will have to be desperate to us those. Southwest here I come.,8/18/2014,1,0,1,1,1,NaN
A Dyer,1,We flew From London Luton to Istanbul Ataturk in Mid-February. After investigating other similar flights AtlasJet (Atlas Global) were about half the price of Turkish Airlines. AtlasJet only fly from London Luton which is a massive bonus for us as we live only 10 miles away from Luton. Our check in and security at London Luton was very quick and easy. Check in etc at Istanbul was harder due to the fact that Turkey have a double screening procedure (Security when just enter the Airport and extra security through to the departures lounge after your check in). Both flights took off a bit late (only 15-20 minutes) but both flights arrived on time. Flight times we thought were excellent with a noon departure to Istanbul and 9am Departure to London Luton. Our outward flight to Istanbul was full but the homeward bound flight to London Luton was less than half full and passengers were allowed to spread out after take-off to either sleep or relax more. We were also served a good quality hot meal which included Turkish wine and beer at no extra cost and the female flying chef who served Turkish cakes near the end of the flight that she had made on board was different and a good U.S.P when compared to other flight carriers. For the price we very impressed with the overall service. The plane used was excellent clean and the seat and leg room was good.,2/24/2015,0,0,0,0,0,10
A Easton,0,LAX-BOG-MDE return in Economy. Seating very tight and food inferior on both the long legs. On the return MDE-BOG we were mingled in with passengers coming in from Madrid to Medellin and it was quite chaotic getting back into the domestic group in Bogota as I was staying a day there. I felt there had been a serious decline in passenger service in the last 12 months even allowing that when I did the same trip a year ago it was in Business. But the check-in staff at LAX were very friendly more-so than in Bogota. Too little English spoken inflight and I think the non-Spanish speaking passengers get a pretty raw deal.,12/1/2010,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,5
A Edgar,1,LHR-MUR return as experienced business travellers there are certain things we expect. We were originally flying BA until they changed the schedule meaning a loss of a days holiday unacceptable when you only have 7 so we changed to Air Mauritius which to be frank I was dreading! Check in fast and efficient fast track through customs as you would expect. As a small airline the lounge is shared with other airlines. A real let down next to no food choice wine etc ok Emirates it wasn't. Once on the plane business seemed reasonably comfortable until you try to sleep the seat doesn't lie flat but sloping to the floor. I'm 5ft 9 and my feet were rammed into the seat in front I didn't sleep a wink all night. Having said that food reasonable wine flowed nicely we couldn't get our TV to work my husband slept most of the way I had a very long night. Return ok lounge very nice food less appealing on the flight home very weird combinations we had 2 full dinners and afternoon tea halfway through. Got the TV to work this time but film selection rubbish.,5/4/2015,4,3,4,2,4,7
A Ehmen Carlotta,0,We have flown with a number of other airlines both internationally and domestic and flying United was a nightmare. Weather is out of everyone's control but management of the overall system is a disaster and not equipped on the front line to deal with flight problems. We normally fly in and out of MSP but United ORD on the surface offered better options for connections to and from Toronto. The problems in Chicago from what information we managed to get (mostly from other passengers both on our flight and other flights) were they did not know where aircraft crews were where the planes were coming and going or what gate (we were moved 3 times-one of which was on the opposite end of the terminal). We have had less delays and problems flying out of MSP in brutal winter weather. They make no announcements and changes are not posted timely and if you can't get an audience with very limited counter agents you find out your flight has been cancelled when the boarding time has come and gone. We witnessed that time and again. We were rebooked on the same flight 24 hours later-and as expected no luggage when we arrived-the tracking showed the time and place it was checked in more than 24 hours earlier at ORD-no progress up the chain in over 24 hours. I honestly feel for the counter people who have to deal with the chaos and irate passengers with little information and resources to fix problems-no wonder they may be less than friendly at times. I do believe there are huge and unnecessary internal problems with this airline (or airport) because we have flown from coast to coast foreign countries and very bad weather with other airlines (and airports) that managed to deal with flight problems in a more efficient and passenger friendly manner. Who cares about the free soda with no ice - it would appear United-ORD has much much bigger problems.,6/25/2014,3,3,1,1,2,1
A Janda,0,"I paid for a Spirit Airlines ticket but my flight was cancelled the day of. The excuse given was bad weather for the incoming plane. Ironically we checked other airlines none of the others had cancelled incoming flights. Furthermore my flight had few seats sold which I thought was very interesting and concerning. The flight was cancelled and the very few customers who had bought tickets were delayed from the morning to the afternoon. The problem is for people with connecting flights. This airline should not be called a ""no frills"" airline but a ""non caring"" airline. When a consumer buys a ticket there's a trust that the flight will be honored. People who were stranded weren't put up in a hotel. The resounding feeling from those on the flight was that they won't fly Spirit again. Once again there are critical time sensitive reasons for travel. Once an airline breaks the customers' trust it is hard to regain.",5/12/2014,5,1,1,1,1,1
A Elliott,0,Flew with SAS from DUB to CPH a week ago. Check-in was easy and smooth and the flight left on time. However from there on things got disappointing. Since the flight was the most expensive one I expected better service than LCC level buy-on-board service which was offered. Also seat comfort was terrible due to the aircraft having those awful Recaro Slimline Seats which are possibly the most uncomfortable things in the sky. Even Ryanair is better than this and they charge a reasonable fare unlike SAS. This is poor value for money. This really lets them down as their crews are very friendly and helpful. What also lets them down is their chaotic hub at CPH. Arriving and departing passengers are not separated and therefore it is a bit difficult to find the baggage reclaim area and it takes a long time to get there. Furthermore the airport is clearly understaffed as we were stuck in the queue at immigration for 15 minutes + which is unacceptable given that the airport had only 1 out of 4 passport control booths open at the time. I would fly SAS again but only if they are cheaper than any other option because the value for money is poor and the comfort is poor.,8/26/2014,2,1,1,1,5,4
A Jansen,1,Flying with Qantas SYD-BNE-TSV as well as BNE-AKL. All the services that I had received were in my opinion in line with the highest quality (ie: on par with SQ and EK) I had received all options when dining. Departing from Sydney can be a nightmare on even the best airlines however we departed and arrived on time with the feel that each passenger was a person not just a seat number. All in all thank you very much Qantas and you are a spirit of Australia.,7/27/2014,5,5,5,5,5,8
A Elsey,0,Doncaster to Dalaman. We went on a flight to Turkey on Onur Air and I have to say the flight was like a Ryanair plane but Turkish. The plane has the worst leg room your could imagine. My farther had to stand up for the whole flight as the leg room was uncomfortable to sit in. The attitude of the crew was very bad as they were rude and looked like they had a sour face at the passengers. Although on the way back to Doncaster the crew were not as bad and were polite. The captain never said anything to the passengers like saying thank you for flying or coming out at the end of the flight to say in person. In conclusion I would not recommend this flight to anybody especially tall people!,10/13/2013,2,1,1,1,1,2
A Jelic,0,Our family vacation from Calgary to Cancun Mexico got off to a bad start. Our flight was scheduled for 9.30am but got delayed 12.5 hrs without any explanation. We were given voucher for taxi to go home with all of our luggage and to come back in the evening to try again. We lost almost 1 day out of our 1 week vacation. I understand that delays are bound to happen from time to time but a 12.5 hrs delay without good reason/explanation is not acceptable.,3/22/2013,1,3,2,2,2,1

Next day check in at 09h00was informed plane was late sit at the airport until that afternoon. No food or drinks was offered to the passengers only boarded plane at 1800.

A Jensen,0,Perth to Karratha on an F100. Friendly staff from the ground staff through to the cabin crew on-board. Aircraft showing it's age but the cabin service was efficient and friendly. Hot breakfast served with tea and coffee all included in the very cheap fare of $159. Skywest has lots of positives going for it and whilst these flights are aimed mainly at the mining companies they will continue to pick up other business with their good product.,2/8/2010,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,4
A Johansson,0,"Helsinki-Hong Kong in business. Food was a great disappointment. I am not exaggerating when I call it an economy class meal. Watch out for something they call ""midnight menu"" because what that means is that there is very little to eat. Finnair has decided that no traveller wants to eat a full dinner on this 10 hour flight which I find strange. Last year they served a full dinner on this route but now they have removed the soup the starter the salad and the noodles completely. The meal is just a tray with main course. If your hungry bring your own. No amenity kit provided but you can ask for some things. They were happy to provide me with a toothbrush but I just think it is very strange that you have to bother the staff for every little thing you need. Not to mention the mismanagement of staff time when they have to run around the cabin to serve the toothbrushes one by one.",6/16/2013,1,3,1,2,3,3
A Eric,0,I am a Million Miler who flies business on long haul with AC. The angle pod seats were a great addition some time ago and provided business passengers with a feeling of value for money-true lay flats reasonable privacy etc. I cannot understand why AC would want to screw this all up with the new high density layouts in both business and economy-the business seats are resulting in mass complaints and mass desertions to other airlines. They downgraded their product to Hong Kong (in economy there are two or three fewer washrooms for 100 more passengers line ups a mile long the toilets are backing up as they are not designed for this volume of passengers. I have never in all my years heard more angry passengers than the Honk Kong to Vancouver AC passengers in any class. For a crass money grab on these routes AC is risking a big revenue loss to Japan airlines Cathay and other Asian airlines and on Europe runs to British Air and others even Lufthansa. This high density move is a complete disaster on the 777's and AC should reconsider. For those of us in the air a lot this change of equipment downgrade is a real choice maker.,3/10/2014,2,1,4,4,5,6
A Johnsen,0,Roundtrip flight from Beijing to Taipei and it was an overall miserable experience. While the crew for the most part was relatively friendly and helpful the planes felt old and well-used (despite being new 737-800s). On both legs rafts took up significant portions of the overhead storage space and on the return flight my seat back was broken and would not stay upright my air blower barely worked which was not pleasant considering how hot the cabin was. Finally my flight out to Taipei was delayed 3 hours and they actually served us our breakfast while still at the gate. This was the only real indication that the delay would be a long one since the very few announcements we received only stated that we were being delayed.,5/15/2012,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,3
A Fajri,1,Return flight. ICN-HAN on A333. First time flying with Asiana. Cabin was hot when we're boarding the plane and many pax complained about it. Leg room and seat comfort not bad old style PTV screen. Some FAs were friendly while some were not. Hot towel and OJ were served before meal. However food wasn't like what I expected. Pillow and blanket were provided. HAN-ICN on newer A333. Delayed 45 mins due to airplane connection problem. Plane was clean and leg room was fantastic. Pillow and blanket provided. FAs seemed to be tired and half-hearted. Wide screen and new version PTV but the ones on my seat and on my friend's seat right behind me froze up and not working at all during the whole flight. Hot towel and OJ were served before meal. Food was worse than the previous flight. Another cup of OJ was provided prior to arrival.,9/10/2012,3,4,2,3,3,6
A Feio,1,FAO-OSL-GTW. Very good aircraft's on both flights Boeing 737-800 with sky interiors just 2 months old. Excellent that we could use wifi on board leg room fair enough. Less points on the service crew they couldn't manage how to speak in English with no manners at all.,8/22/2013,4,5,1,1,5,5

A Johnson,1,It's very little hassle flights are almost always on time customer service is great. I enjoy the occasional jokes over the PA and the creative ways of doing the safety briefing.

A Fernando,1,Really great and friendly service from the cabin crew. Good food (compared to other airlines) and very polite flight attendants. The flight got delayed 5 hours due to a bad thunderstorm at the Delhi airport and the flight had to land at Jaipur airport.

A Johnston,1,October 13 YVR to MNL Business class on a 777-300. Very comfortable seating great service and reasonably good food (only ate breakfast).

A Field,1,This was the fourth time I travelled with Jet2. Despite the aircraft being of an age that would have qualified it for an aviation museum it appeared in good condition with good legroom and seating.

A Jones,0,Flew with Spirit from Baltimore to Las Vegas. The flight was fine plane was clean we arrived on time. Already had a problem with having to pay for our bags get to Vegas waited for the bags at the carousel after 15 mins of waiting for the bags to start coming off the entire flight was told that our bags were not put on the plane they were still in Baltimore. Was told our bags would be delivered to us by noon the next day. So here we are in Vegas with nothing waiting for it to be convenient for spirit to send us our bags. The bags should have been placed on a flight once they realized the mistake they made. I will never fly with them again.,5/20/2015,1,3,3,1,1,1
A Finister,0,Went from Manchester to Orlando and back both premium economy. Bulkhead seats had TV's that came out of the seat only for them not to stay upright had to hold it to watch it air con not working it was hotter than Florida itself. Lost one of our cases. Staff clocked off a good hour before landing and just chatted between themselves ignoring all the passengers.

A Jordon,1,I recently used the last 2 credits of my Air Canada Sunpass (YUL-LAS) that I purchased in August 2013 fully Decided to take Air Canada Rouge to Orlando from Winnipeg. The only problem we needed to get to Toronto. No big deal since Air Canada flies out of that city. Well a typical Air Canada flight was then met with a fresh and fun flight on Rouge to Orlando. Inflight entertainment was easy to use and reliable. Young hardworking staff. Both pilots stood at the front and said goodbye to passengers something you don't always see. Was it cramped - not really as I'm 6'1 and was able to stretch my legs beneath the seat.,5/13/2014,4,3,4,5,5,9
A Firth,0,I am writing this on behalf of my wife who is currently flying the wrong way across Europe due to the incompetence of this shambolic operation. She was booked to fly from Hanover to London Stansted. There was a short delay and the passengers got on. The passengers were then told to get off as astonishingly the crew needed to finish their shift. They were left waiting for three hours without any information. When they re-boarded the flight they were told they would be flying to Cologne instead of London to pick up more passengers. A bit like one of those cheap taxi buses I guess. Hopefully she'll make it home before I have to go to work tomorrow. Looking at the other reviews I would seriously think twice before booking with this outfit.,9/9/2014,2,3,1,0,2,NaN
A Joslin,0,I traveled to Columbo Sri Lanka in January 2014 with a stop over at Kuwait City on the outward and return journeys. The airport itself was like most no good or bad points. The flights on the other hand were shocking. The outward journey was bearable but only because the plane was only half full. The journey back to the UK was disgusting the staff (all male in economy) were rude and argumentative they ignored us. At meal times I had to ask for our dinner as they passed us by. The toilets were filthy toilet paper all over the floor the floor itself was soaking and not cleaned throughout the journey. The inflight entertainment was poor half the TV's on the seats didn't work if they did the sound was poor. There were no alcoholic drinks allowed on the flight so it was soft drinks tea or coffee. I could go on but I think I have made my point.,7/3/2014,2,3,3,1,1,1
A Fisher,1,My flight to Frankfurt and back from Haneda on the 787 was not quite a dream but it was quite nice. The service was especially good. And the washlets were a nice surprise. I doubt that US airlines will see the value in installing them. There was one problem though. I sat in the front row of the rear economy section both ways to enjoy the extra leg room However there are three toilets just in front of that section. And the doors automatically bang shut unless the user holds the door and closes it carefully. It was especially annoying during the lights dimmed sleep period.,6/18/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Fleming,0,LHR to Kabul return. Outbound excellent check-in and very impressive Gulf Air lounge. Onboard A330 seating was ok but short of offerings by their Gulf based competitors. A good menu available well presented and tasty with a good selection of wines and other beverages. Rather than the installed IFE C class passengers were given standalone equipment which had a fair range of viewing options. Transit in Bahrain was fine lounge had a great view over the apron and friendly staff but furnishings very tired and early morning food offerings not the best. Connecting flight on A320 C class had 2-2 configuration. Meal served was fair alcoholic drinks only available on request. Return was a sharp contrast - flight cancelled and no help at airport. Finally booked to fly 4 days late. Check-in the usual chaos with no dedicated C class line. Once through the plane did not appear for several hours. Information very poor left in the lounge for several hours. Finally the plane landed departure delayed until the next morning. Baggage not returned and people left to fend for themselves. Eventually we flew with no proper meal. Red eye flight to London on A340 offered the best seat/cabin served light evening snacks which were tasty and an average breakfast. On arrival in LHR 4 days late I had to wait over an hour for my bag. Overall I accept I was unlucky but would probably not take this route again if I could avoid it.,6/13/2012,3,3,3,3,2,3
A Jumani,0,Flew with a family of 4 children to Dubai for a week first time and last time with Pegasus. A day before departure I was called to be informed that the flight 'might' be cancelled. The uncertainty helped make it a stressful day. At check-in was informed that the flight was not cancelled but we may be changed to Azerbaijan Airways for the Dubai leg and have an additional stop. Finally arrived at Dubai only to find out that our 5 checked in pieces of baggage primarily the children's items had been sent to Cyprus. Promised to have them in 24 hours but took over 3 days. To make matters even worse I had to go back to the airport to collect the bags. Overall I would pay the extra next time to fly with a more reliable carrier.,1/2/2013,1,1,1,1,1,NaN
A Kale,0,I was scheduled to travel on a non-stop Scoot flight from Singapore to Sydney by Business Class a few days ago. The flight was scheduled to take off from Singapore at 1.45am and arrive into Sydney at 12.40pm. The flight got progressively delayed and finally took off around 5.30am. Then for some unknown reason it stopped in Perth before continuing to Sydney. Finally it landed in Sydney over six hours behind schedule at 7pm. I missed my onward connections to Canberra. So moral of the story is that if you have to reach somewhere on time do not travel by Scoot as they are usually late.,2/19/2014,1,2,1,2,1,1

Ran out of my choice of meal but crew were great. Singapore to LHR on 777-300 ER instead of A380 but managed to get two seats together at the back of the plane. Food quality not great and they again ran out of my meal choice for breakfast.

A Forest,0,22nd Dec. Huge Ice storm delaying operations out of Toronto Pearson airport. Any other airline had delay information posted on the screen and vouchers for passengers to purchase food inside the terminal. Sunwing had nothing the agents knew nothing. Flying on 513 to Cancun. We find out after 2 hours of sitting on the aircraft that we had been offloaded and our suitcase was not onboard. I inquired to the agent about my luggage if they could load it on since we had 2 more hrs to wait they said yes and I was reassured that it had been placed back on. Passengers had been waiting for more than 4hrs with not one drinks service. I had to tell the crew to turn the lights from bright to low. Since it was a new 737-800 the CSM had no clue how to operate the system. Sandwiches shouldn't of been served after such a long delay. They were soggy cold and the paper was stuck to them. Arrive at destination no luggage. Return flight same thing delay 2hrs no APU closed door stuffy cabin with a more pro- active crew that instantly did a water service.

I called their number in Morocco and was told that the Lisbon-Casablanca flight had been cancelled and they had been unable to reach me. They offered no solution other than a flight 8 days later else I should send a complaint to their email address.

A Frame,0,I checked in and arrived in good time at East Midlands airport on 10th July for a 19.50 flight to Glasgow. 45 minutes before departure the flight information notified that the flight had been cancelled. A protracted process followed whereby Glasgow passengers were transferred on to the Edinburgh flight which was delayed by over 2 hours. On arrival at Edinburgh we were transferred 40 miles by bus to Glasgow Airport. This would have been bad enough but I also had an interesting conversation with two East Midlands staff who told me that the airline had also pulled the Glasgow flight in similar circumstances on the previous 2 days. It seems that Flybe are cancelling flights on economic grounds but remain happy for passengers to turn up at airports in the full knowledge that their flights will not be operating. I also note with some interest that they have pulled the same stunt today with their morning Cardiff - Glasgow flight.,7/17/2013,2,3,0,0,2,NaN

Due to Business Class being full 5 rows of economy didn't get served a refreshment at all on the flight. This is very poor cabin management. The crew were taking their time fully aware that they'd never get the service done. Even thought it's just a drink it left a very poor taste in my mouth from a PR perspective especially when they tried to blame bad weather.,8/19/2012,3,3,1,4,2,4
A Kessler,1,Geneva-Doha Doha KL on 29th/30th Jan 2014. Embarkation at Geneva was smooth and efficient. The flight attendants were most attentive and the food excellent. Arriving at Doha and going to the Premium Transfer complex is a breeze. Food seating capacity showers it is all there and certainly a notch over most other airlines' premium facilities I would say. Had a few hours to spend in the Premium facility and time passed quickly. The flight from Doha to KL was excellent also: flight attendants present and anticipating your needs. The food very good indeed. My only problem with the Airbus 330-300 is the angled seats when trying to sleep. I thoroughly dislike them as there is not much space to put things away and one is not lying flat (I need a flat surface for medical reasons). I don't understand why the seats are angled in the Airbus but not on the 777? I hope to fly again with Qatar but on their Boeing 777 rather than on their Airbuses.,4/2/2014,5,3,5,5,5,8

I can walk certain distances but not as far as through airports and to planes. My friends drove me to the airport but had to get a wheelchair for me because they had no one to do it for me. Then they did not have anyone to push me through security and to the gate so my friend had to get a pass to push me through all that. At the gate an older man with a cane came over beside me and there were some wheelchairs sitting there so he got one to sit in and asked me if I knew why there was no help for us. Usually handicapped people are boarded first along with people with children and first class passengers. This did not happen with Allegiant Air. They boarded a long line of what seemed to be a lot of first class passengers and I don't know who else before the actually asked the older gentlemen if we needed help to the plane. They finally pushed us to the plane. My assigned seat was in the second row so I don't know where the so-called first class people were sitting. The biggest insult came after landing in South Bend IN. They announced that people waiting for wheelchairs were to remain on the plane until all other passengers were gone. I was surprised to see several wheelchairs sitting just outside the plane door but no people to push them. Finally someone came and pushed me into the airport. Another point against Allegiant Air is when I tried to print my boarding pass it wouldn't let me. This is usually because I have to carry a POC (oxygen concentrator) to use on board. I printed the page telling me this because they charge $5.00 if your boarding pass has to be printed at the airport. Foolishly I thought since I showed them I couldn't print my boarding pass they wouldn't charge me $5.00 but they did without telling me. It just showed up on my credit card. The two women at the ticket counter were unfriendly and at times downright rude. The attitude was this is the way it is so take it or leave it. It is not an airline I will ever fly again.,3/4/2015,2,3,0,0,1,NaN
A Gaitan,0,JJ3558 IGU-GRU 16 Oct 2013. Fly this route usually every month. TAM is dropping the quality of service and it shows. Should be considered a low cost airline and not a standard airline. At check in we were almost forced to do self check in seats with more space are sold separately and until last month they served a mini sandwich with 3 choices of cold drinks (no coffee or hot tea) now a small bag of peanuts.,10/22/2013,2,2,1,0,4,2
A Galffy,0,Delayed our flight from Venice to Budapest because the crew didn't turn up on time and we lost our connecting flight. We had to stay in Budapest for 2 days and ended up spending $700 for their negligence. They have hidden fees they do not tell you about until you input your credit card information. Flight attendants were rude unfriendly.,8/25/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Gallo,0,Just flew back from Casablanca to JFK - the airplane was dirty. The food was terrible. My daughter is a coeliac - requested a gluten free meal when booking and told no problem. They gave her a regular meal with bread and cake. Advised them it was a problem - they looked at us like we were crazy. Service from the flight attendants was terrible. Wanted a glass of water - went to the 'kitchen' area - 2 flight attendants were fast asleep. The bathrooms were disgusting. Never Again.,12/28/2012,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,1
A King,1,Recently took four Kenya Airways flights between London and Tanzania and every flight arrived at the destination early staff were friendly and helpful food was good and the flight price was excellent for this time of the year.

A Garcia,0,Booked a ticket for a flight leaving from London Gatwick on Friday 25 July going to Fort Lauderdale for a family funeral on Sunday morning. Given the circumstances I bought the tickets on Friday morning no delays were listed and I went straight to the airport. There the flight was initially delayed from 14.20 on Friday to 6.50am the next morning according to the representative at the desk. At the same moment received a text from Norwegian to say that the flight was delayed until 11pm the same night. No one knew what was going on. Eventually the flight was delayed twice more first until midnight on Saturday (a 32 hour delay) and then again until 8.50am on Sunday morning (a 40 hour delay). At this point I have been waiting at Gatwick for hours while the flight was pushed later and later. The final delay would have had me missing the funeral and no would could guarantee that further delays would not be incurred. I had to cancel my ticket and book a new one with BA for double the price which left right on time and gave me no issues. I cannot tell you how stressful this entire situation was at an already difficult time. I will never book with Norwegian again.,7/31/2014,1,0,0,0,3,NaN
A Kleinzahler,1,Luton-Warsaw-Luton. I printed my boarding passes (2 pages) from the online site and did not have any bags to check-in. The planes were bright. Cabin crew friendly. Leaving the plane at Warsaw delayed because it seemed impossible to find steps that would reach to the right height of the aircraft door. Same problem on return leg. On the outward flight seat pitch was comfortable but on the return seat pitch was very cramped and uncomfortable. Luckily the plane was not full and no-one sat in the middle seat of my row but this is not ideal for a long flight. I used their minibus service from Warsaw airport to the city. As we arrived late at night and with a delay I was pleased the bus had waited. Driver friendly but drove like a maniac down long straight roads with little traffic from the airport and through a few red lights. Overall good service but would hesitate to use Wizz again because of the seat-pitch being so small.,6/5/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,7
A Garrett,1,EWR-OPO-BRU and AMS-LIS-EWR. Was pleasantly surprised by the practicality and quality of this airline. They fly the Newark - Porto route twice/week and the Newark - Lisbon route the remaining 5 days. I paid only $789 for the round trip multi city flight and although I couldn't pick seats until 24 hours prior to departure I got window seats both ways and a bulkhead window seat on the return from Lisbon to Newark (11j)! Food was decent/edible although they were a little stingy on wine and tea/coffee ( they only fill glasses half way and are bad on refills). The A332 from Newark to Porto was newer then the return aircraft and had touchscreen on demand entertainment with dozens of movies including new releases like 12 yrs a slave and Dallas Buyers Club. The return A332 had personal TVs as well but the movies were on channels 1-16 and started at a set time. Flew Portugalia operated Fokker 100 to Brussels from Porto which was fine. They served a lox sandwich. Food on the return Lisbon to EWR flight had descent food - fish pie (like shepherds) and a prosciutto sandwich as a snack before landing. All edible which is how I rate airline food (edible or non-edible).,3/27/2014,5,5,4,4,4,8
A Kobayashi,0,"We were excited to hear that Air Canada was adding routes to Europe way back when we started booking a big family vacation this allowed us to fly into Venice and out of Rome on AC flights both ways. At the time Rouge had just started its international service so we didn't know what to expect but it's Air Canada right? It has to be at least decent. I have to say at this point thank goodness we changed our return flight date which meant we went from a Rouge flight to a regular AC flight. Travelling over 8 hours to Italy in those cramped circa 1970s metal framed seats was not fun and I had the luxury of a 4 year old next to me so I could use some of her space. I am not a tall person and I felt like my knees were in my armpits the entire time because of the ridiculously small seat pitch you can't actually recline your seat more than an inch maybe two inches. Fantastic for an overnight flight. At least they gave us pillows and blankets. Hardly any of us slept and it was a long boring flight since we don't all have ipads and theirs were booked. I'm curious to know how there is still no Android app for their stupid in-flight entertainment system but I digress. People also need to know that the reviews here are accurate regarding the overhead bins they are not regular carry-on size each bin could fit maybe 1 item - for 4 seats! I would also like to point out that flying Rouge is definitely a buyer beware activity. I'm not sure if there are any cases of the prices reflecting the ""bargain airline"" thing they are trying to be but I think it is all kinds of insanity to charge the same for this service as for regular Air Canada flights. I know this is true because AC had a schedule change that meant we went from a regular flight to a Rouge flight and the gentleman at the call centre warned me that we would be getting less service for the same money. In fact he was required to explain that to me and I had to agree and it was made clear that this would be recorded so that there would be no ""misunderstandings."" As a result I got so nervous I changed that flight to a different day to avoid having to fly Rouge home and thank goodness for that. Two of our party were in business class on Rouge that meant Premium Rouge or some such silliness and they had slightly bigger seat space and a curtain to divide them from the steerage behind on Air Canada they had pods with lie flat beds for the same price. I'm sad to say that this is no exaggeration. Now if I pay a little bit of money for a discount flight on a bargain airline okay I expect to get what I paid for - not much. But when you are paying full Air Canada fare and get bargain airline seats and service I'm not okay with it. People need to know that this is going on and make their dissatisfaction known with their dollars.",9/18/2014,1,1,2,1,3,2
A Gathercoal,0,Santa Cruz Bolivia to Sao Paulo Brazil - a saving of about $50US over GOL. At the airport check-in was easy. I recommend that you arrive early to avoid the impending line. The counter staff was as friendly and they did not charge me for my extra luggage weight. I was impressed by the 737 that AeroSur is using on this international flight [do note that most AeroSur flights use aging 727s]. The flight attendants served a box meal and drinks on this two hours flight and we arrived on time. .,10/8/2007,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Gautam,0,KTM-KUL-MNL return. The cost cutting is evident and so is the total lack of service from the FA's. The 737-800 operated in all the sectors were fine so was the IFE. As soon as the sub standard meals were served the lights dimmed and the crew disappeared happy to chat and laugh out loud amongst themselves. For a 4 hrs 30 mins flight after the first hour I did not notice any crew before the captain announced it was time for touchdown. This appalling service is simply not acceptable.,8/3/2014,3,3,2,3,1,3
A Gautam,0,BKK-CMB 13 Dec. Its Thai Smile operating this sector now which is close to a budget carrier but since it uses the same TG call sign many would not notice. New plane but cramped seats smallest portion of awful food. No IFE blankets or pillows for this red eye flight. The previous time I flew this route Thai had a newish A330 with full service and I had to pay the same price whilst flying Thai Smile which makes it a bad value for money.,12/17/2013,2,2,1,1,3,2
A Gemmell,1,Just returned from Tenerife with Thomson but used the Jet2 flights. Very nice welcome by several staff at Glasgow. Sadly flight delayed on return and not give much info as to reason. Nice planes with good legroom. Only grievance is that like other operators Jet2 have fallen into the trap of overcharging for drinks to a point it is clear they just want to 'fleece' you. I accept they need the income but I do wonder if reducing prices would still make good money.,6/2/2013,0,4,2,NaN,5,7
A Kovacevic,0,I flew to Europe on June 15 from Fort Myers (FL) to Duesseldorf. My previous trip was in January 2013 (Berlin- Miami). Company changed their fees on June 1st and nobody had a courtesy to let me know that even though I am their top bonus member (frequent flyer program). I called before my flight to double check and asked if there is anything else I should be aware of (I flew with them few times before so I was familiar with their policies) and teller forgot to mention they changed baggage fees (from 50Euros to 200$). Customer service representative at the check in desk forgot to mention that too and she just transferred me to the cashier and it was than when I found out about the charge! I don't mind paying but I do mind being ripped off! Besides that their seats are very small and food quality could be better (a lot better).,8/7/2013,1,1,2,3,3,2
A George,0,"Downgraded this review because of the fact that the ""new seats"" are the most uncomfortable I have ever sat in on an airplane.

A Kronaus,0,Amsterdam-Warsaw-Toronto return. Planes old and uncomfortable. Food is barely edible. Entertainment shocking. Most of the cabin staff do not speak English. Amsterdam to Warsaw ended in a divert to Katowize due to bad weather. Luckily our connection to Toronto had been delayed anyway - turned out all in all was delayed 4 hrs which put us 4 hrs late in Toronto. Delays are expected due to snow however LOT only offered drinks / food around 3 hours into the delay. Initial attempts to land in Warsaw were aborted 3 times due to visibility - at least safety was a concern! Baggage was slightly damaged on both journeys which was disappointing. I would not travel LOT again.,4/18/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,3
A Gibson,1,Qantas had a two for one business class fare deal going so we booked to the USA. We booked 4x seats. My kids are aged 9 and 14. Did the USA theme parks and had a great time. Qantas staff on the flights were great with the kids. They asked the kids what they wanted to eat and drink and then combined some of the meal options from first and business to make sure the kids were well fed. We all got plenty of sleep and it felt like the flight was 5 hours instead of 13. The seats fully reclined to a bed and we got pyjamas pillows and doonas. The service was without fault.,1/30/2015,5,5,4,4,5,10
A Krummacher,0,CMB-BKK-CMB. Both legs on an old A340-300. The outbound flight was delayed 4 what annoys me is that UL knew about this delay well in advance yet did not contact passengers ahead of time. Delay voucher was given for a filthy breakfast in the airport restaurant. Food on the outbound flight was terrible and no other alcoholic beverages apart from beer and wine were served. What a plunge in service! Return flight left BKK on time again food not great but this time at least 'proper' drinks were served. Unfortunately if you want to avoid red eye flights between CMB and BKK you have to use UL all other airlines fly at ungodly hours in the middle of the night.,1/28/2012,2,4,1,3,2,2
A Gil,0,I flew to Windhoek on SA078 25 July. I was very pleased to have had the opportunity to fly on the 320. The seats were so spacious with lots of leg room but I was so disappointed with the service. The dinner was served and the drinks trolley arrived once everyone in my part of the cabin had already finished their dessert. SAA has never placed a bottle of water on the trays as many airlines do and their service is not constant. We ate our dinner without anything to drink. What a pity as the airfares are not cheap on this route.,8/3/2014,3,5,1,1,3,5
A Krummacher,1,BKK-CMB-FRA return in business class. On all flights except the CMB-FRA sector we had their new lie flat business class seats. It was quite upsetting that this configuration was not available on the long CMB-FRA flight moreover as this was a red-eye flight. Check-in in BKK quick and efficient given priority passes for security and immigration. Lounge in BKK is Air France - quite sterile and no real food. Service on board was excellent delicious meal served. IN CMB boarded from the bus gate air conditioning not working and business class boarded last - weird! Luggage in FRA came out last despite being tagged priority. On the return flight quick check-in at FRA. UL is using the JAL lounge - quite poor choice of food available. Great dinner on board but not sure why they serve a 2nd dinner just before a 5am arrival in CMB. Serendib lounge in CMB closed due to renovation used another old fashioned lounge but was quite ok. Flight to BKK left 30 mins late. Delicious breakfast served on board. Entertainment on all flights quite a joke. Choice extremely limited and the AVOD system in business class is almost impossible to navigate. Luggage in BKK came out first. UL business class product clearly has some shortcomings but given that the ticket is only nominally more expensive than an economy class ticket on some other airlines it is still a good choice and value for money.,7/29/2013,4,4,5,2,5,7
A Kumar,0,DEL-PEK-DEL Business Class. Outbound check-in surprised to find that there was no dedicated check-in for business class. Boarding was swift and departure on time. Boeing 757-300 was not appropriate for 7 hour flight to Beijing. The product was outdated with old recliner style seats arranged 2x2 with decent legroom and was clean and well-mantained considering the age. IFE from mainscreen was poor and a problem on a day-time flight. Two meals were offered - hot canapes inedible and out of place even in economy class. FAs attentive and professional. A few hours later lunch was served which was much better with generous portions and good quality. Arrival in Beijing was without any hassles. Beijing-Delhi check-in was a mess in spite of a dedicated business class counter - unfriendly and inept staff. The whole process took over twenty minutes. Old Boeing 767 with the same seats but PTV's - IFE choice was limited with 3 movies running on loops. Hardly inspiring considering AVOD being a norm now even on many regional carriers. The dinner was of a high standard. The real issues came when I landed in Delhi. In spite of a new terminal Ethiopian had no clear signage as to where the bags were being delivered. Subsequently upon finding the correct conveyer belt I discovered my priority tagged luggage had not been off-loaded with the conveyer belt showing bags delivered for the flight. The same was with another passenger on the flight. Ethopian Airlines staff could not be found and when we finally found one we came across one of the most unhelpful and petulent staff I have come across. The person was firstly dismissive stating bags would come in later until we had to show him the screen on the conveyer belt. Finally he picked up his cell phone and dialled someone asking for two black bags. No attempt was made to check on the baggage ticket numbers. Finally we waited another ten minutes until he stated that it was time for him to go home and the bags would be delivered. We had to involve the customer service desk at Delhi airport who were helpful and ensured that we were attended to. Planes old punctuality good and inflight service excellent but the outdated product poor ground handling at Beijing and Delhi are major negatives.,12/30/2010,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,5

A Gingrich,0,SLC-DEN-MDW - Flying with my 3 kids and 2 nephews to visit Grandpa in Chicago. On our Denver layover after waiting for 5 hours our flight was canceled due to electrical problems at MDW. We were directed to the SW ticket gate into a line with hundreds of people. After waiting in the line for an hour with 5 kids and hearing other passengers leave the line being told they would not get a flight for 2 days I found a hotel and rented a car for the night. In the morning I called SW to ask about rebooking our canceled flight. The agent told me I had to go to the airport to get someone to do it for me. She confirmed that my only option to get on a SW flight would be to drag 5 kids to the airport to wait for the next available flight in 40 hours and hope we got on that one. That is not a reasonable option so we rented a minivan in Denver and drove to Chicago. SW also lost our luggage. Multiple attempts to call resulted in no one helping us. When we arrived in Chicago went to Midway and the bag was sitting there. I am so frustrated with an industry that is all take no give. You make them all these guarantees jump through their hoops and they give you nothing in return not even a refund when their product fails.,7/1/2012,2,3,0,NaN,2,2

A Kupferman,0,Flight EK375 Business Class from Bangkok to Dubai on May 23 2015 on a A380. After viewing all those promotional videos from Emirates I decided to use that airline to fly to Riyadh via Bangkok and must confess that I am somewhat disappointed. The lounge in Bangkok is quite plain and sterile with a very limited choice of food. As to the flight itself seats are not ergonomic: the armrest is very short due to the separation panel between seat and corridor and the table is difficult to pull out if you are very slightly overweight. Emirates is quite stingy with amenities and even socks are taken away at the end of the flight if unused. Service was efficient but it cannot be compared with the one on Etihad where you can wine and dine anytime and where the choice of drinks and the quality of food is far superior to what is offered on Emirates. Flight attendants were relatively indifferent. The bar of course is very nice and that is the best thing on that flight. The cabin decoration is reminiscent of a hospital corridor. All in all a flight without surprise but next time I will go back to the friendly Thai people or to the excellent Etihad performance.,5/27/2015,0,3,3,5,3,7
A Godfrey,1,Flew Brisbane - Hong Kong on August 16. Due to a mix up in online check-in I had been allocated seat 60B nearly the worst seat on the aircraft and impossible to change. At the airport (a 55 minute wait for the 'bag drop') the check-in attendant initially said there was no hope of getting a better seat but eventually managed to find me 27A a window seat in the 'quiet' zone just behind Business. Also an express pass through security. Lunch was served promptly and bottles of water distributed although it was a day flight the window shades were all pulled down. Crew very helpful - endless pot noodles for those who wanted snacks plenty of water and soft drinks passed around and - ice cream.

A Gordon,0,I flew Air from Sydney to Delhi and return because it was a non stop flight. On entering the aircraft it looked old and I found that my touch screen did not work. The toilets were disgusting smelt and were stained. Some panels were hanging loose. The floor was awash. On return the aircraft looked newer but the toilets were still disgraceful. I had to fly via Melbourne which was a pain in the neck as we had to disembark in Melbourne and go through a stringent security check again. On take off the cabin crew did not do a safety check of passengers and we took off with one passenger asleep across three seats unrestrained. One passenger had tray table down and that was what I could see from my seat. The cabin crew avoided eye contact at all times. During the long overnight flight from Delhi children were allowed to run amok. Food mediocre. Would never use again.,3/19/2015,2,3,3,2,3,4

A Green,0,Ryanair never cease to plunge to new depths in customer experience. Always looking for a new way to con passengers into falling foul of a regulation so they can extort money to bring their cheap fares in to line with the proper airlines.

A Grieve,1,Business cabin in 787 comprises 18 seats in 3 rows. However 6 of the seats are compromised as 2 are designated window seats but do not have a window and 4 are in close proximity to the lavatories. The middle seats in the front row are worst as you definitely notice everyone passing you. Additionally there are no privacy screens and a lack of usable storage space other than overhead bins. Otherwise staff are excellent and the seats quite comfortable. Food and drink is more than adequate.,10/22/2014,4,4,3,3,5,7
A Langefors,1,SVO-DEL A330. First time with Aeroflot was a pleasant surprise. No trouble at all and a very professional service. Vegetarian meal had been ordered and was delivered without having to ask for it. On one leg the food was a disaster but on the return flight it was really good.

A Griggs,0,Flew LHR-ADD-ZNZ and return (via DAR). Unable to check in online for every flight as they changed the type of plane for every sector at the last minute. Flight to ADD was fine but we sat near the back of the plane be warned that the crew use the overhead bins for storage of snacks/breakfast items. Towards the end of the flight they closed one of the 4 toilets and had to use that as storage due to the lack of space on the 757. ADD-ZNZ (via DAR) departs from T1 where there is absolutely nothing to do or see. ET do not hand out arrival cards so they have to be filled out once at the airport. By far the worst flight was ZNZ-ADD where they brought out a smaller plane (737-700 instead of 800) which meant the plane was felt extremely cramped as there was a 100% load. Finally ADD-LHR was fine apart from they insisted on serving a full meal at 03.30am and then a small muffin and juice just before landing. From what I saw 60% of the flight didn't take the main meal and slept through. In my opinion it would have been better for them to serve the muffin at 3 am and the main meal for breakfast when everyone was awake.,4/16/2013,2,2,3,1,1,2
A Lapchinski,1,Club class from Toronto to Dublin and back in Sep 2012. To DUB was in second row and could not see drop down screen at all. Did not eat dinner which was served at 10.30 at night.

Began to wonder about the wisdom of paying extra for Club class. But on the way back-what a difference! Individual television sets. I was in row 1 and could stretch my legs out straight. Started with champagne before takeoff then drinks after take-off meal service with wine (I picked my choice 45 days before) after dinner drinks chocolate bars and pringles Irish coffee light lunch before landing warm cookies and finally chocolate. Seat even had an electrical plug. Club class includes complimentary blanket pillow ear buds hot wipes etc.,10/4/2012,5,5,5,4,5,8

A Grotenhuis,1,Have made several flights with Aegean Airlines in the past year. It was very good value for money. Flights mostly on time inflight service exceptional and friendly FA's. Helpful ground staff. Overall this will be my preferred carrier to Greece.,2/7/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,10
A Lecka,1,In the past two weeks I flew with LIAT on multiple occasions: Barbados - Grenada. Grenada - Trinidad. Trinidad - St Lucia. Dominica - Barbados. I must say all of our flights were on time. Luggage was there each time and overall we had a pleasant experience with LIAT. The standard of service is average for a cheap airline - flights are short haul so you shouldn't expect much. Safety instructions were given life jackets were there attendants would always answer your questions. What is required was for sure there. As an add-on compared to European cheap airlines - you even get your seat assigned!,5/2/2015,4,4,0,0,4,8
A Guild,1,We flew from Birmingham to Melbourne with stops in Dubai and KL - very satisfactory. Excellent lounges and good departure times so the trip was as painless as possible. Service varied from ok to excellent. Seat 9A and 9B were well positioned comfortable and with good appointments and spaces for storage. Emirates is clearly a top class airline with all the trimmings that a long time traveller expects (for the $$$!). Their entertainment system is a bit hard to navigate. Program selection fantastic.,3/30/2015,5,5,4,4,4,9
A Lee,1,"LHR-BOM-LHR on A330. I went out in Business return in First. Superb service both ways. Business Class cabin is well appointed with an excellent seating layout and plenty of room. One criticism would be the lack of storage space in the seat. The food was wonderful. Return I was in First and the trip could not have been better. Comfortable seat 23"" screen and a huge range of entertainment. A flat wide bed in a private cabin was fantastic.",2/22/2012,5,5,5,5,5,9
A Gurevich,0,JNB-IAD-JNB old dirty plane blankets smelt very limited choice of movies. On return the flight was cancelled due to technical issues gate staff called transit police at IAD a few times when passengers started asking questions about reasons for the delay it turned out they cancelled this flight 3 days in a row.,2/17/2012,1,1,1,1,1,1
A Leger,1,LX348 GVA to LHR January 21st 2015 Airbus A321 seat 26A. Mid-afternoon flight nearly full. The middle seat was empty which made the flight more comfortable. A soft pretzel sandwich beverages and chocolates were served. Visited the SWISS Senator Lounge before departure. Arrived in London almost on time. I walked a great distance through LHR Terminal 2 to the gate of my next flight.,1/28/2015,5,5,5,0,5,10
A Guruprasad,1,PVG-SIN. Interesting experience. After some exercise walking around the terminal to check in found the Biz class check in and found the service courteous but the area run down in appearance. Made it through immigration and security easily but struggled to find the correct lounge. Once there it was not worth the effort. Uncomfortable seats and well worn furnishings. Strolled down to the gate and learned that departure time is the real boarding time. Fought my way through the line onto the bus and then shoved my way to the stairs and made the climb. I found if I didn't assert myself I would keep getting cut in front of the line. Once onboard seats were old style angled beds. Service was courteous and smiles were plentiful. My jacket was ignored until about 3 hours into the flight. My meal order was taken chicken ordered and beef delivered. Debated pointing this out but decided between my language skills and the crew's skills I should enjoy the beef. I think there were inflight announcements from the cockpit but they were difficult to hear. I did have to ask for water about halfway into the flight and after asking got regular top offs. Would I do it again? Probably but would not do a TransPac. For a five hour trip service and food was up there with service I have received on US carriers.,6/6/2015,4,3,4,0,4,7
A Leung,0,Hong Kong to Bangkok round trip. Everything fine on the Bangkok side. However after landing at Hong Kong side waited 30 minutes on the plane for the shuttle bus to the terminal. The luggage claim took around 20 minutes. The dinner was cold chicken meat with rice. Totally agree you get what you pay.,1/4/2008,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,3
A Lewis,0,A group of us were planning a trip to SVD and BGI first to SVD then back to BGI. We arrived in Barbados from Canada at 2.30pm July 18th 2014 our connection to St Vincent was to be at 7pm. Arrived at the gate around 5.30 only to notice that it was so full of people we would have to stand or sit on the floor. At 9.30pm we were called to the desk at the gate to be advised that our flight had been cancelled. Shuffled from one part of the airport to another no instructions given no vouchers for food we were then met by disgruntled LIAT staff on the outside of the airport who seemed to be aimlessly writing down our passport numbers but giving us no indication as to what we were supposed to do next. Eventually told to get on a bus and go to the hotel. The next morning no LIAT personnel could answer our questions or tell us what was going on. At 2pm we were on our way they went from not being able to find any planes anywhere to all of a sudden finding one to get us out of there! The way back from St Vincent to Barbados had a 2 hour delay. LIAT is by far more detrimental to the Caribbean's economy than any Hurricane or natural disaster to hit the region.,8/18/2014,1,3,0,0,2,NaN
A Gyba,0,Firstly flight delayed 6 hours out of YYZ to LAS. Sure breakdowns happen. I was tracking the history of the aircraft online and it has been broken down and attempted to be put back into service 4 times in a week. I am 6 foot tall and the lack of leg room was not only insulting it is bordering on a health and safety issue. Air Canada Rouge would rather make the extra few bucks off cramming a few more seats on the plane than worry about whether passengers will be able to walk again after flying with them. I am so upset that I have cancelled my return flight with this airline.,1/28/2015,1,1,1,1,1,1
A Libien,1,Air Pacific economy SYD-NAN-HNL and LAX-NAN-SYD. SYD-NAN on 747 was reasonable. Hot lunch served with beverages. Seats reasonably comfortable. FAs quite pleasant. FAs asked passengers to return seats to upright position during mealtimes which I appreciated. NAN-HNL on 737 a small plane for an 8-hour flight. FAs wonderful with humour and a smile. Food was okay hot breakfast before arrival in HNL. LAX-NAN on 747. Check-in LAX was quick counters opened nearly 4 hours before flight time. Service superb meals a bit disappointing for an overnight flight. Transfer in NAN was chaotic and departure lounge at NAN is way too small. One set of toilets for 4 flights in departure lounge. NAN-SYD standard of service dropped markedly. Crew couldn't wait to get to SYD. Overall we found our Air Pacific experience on 4 flights to be positive.,10/28/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,7
A Hailey,0,SJO-SAT. Supposed to leave SJO and be home by 3:30pm on Saturday. Did not arrive home until Monday at 3.30 pm. This airline was a joke. The first day they had us wait in the airport for 12 hours only to tell us we wouldn't be able to leave. The next day our flight was delayed due to a flight attendant not having correct documentation to leave the country. Due to the delay half the flight missed their connections in Mexico City causing another overnight stay. We were never offered a refund for the flight or any inconvenience it caused.,3/20/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,2
A Lili,0,"I've been flying back and forth with JetBlue for the past 6 years. I fly once every other month. At first I was so satisfied with the service that I have never flown with any other airline. But lately the past year especially the service has gone downhill. The staff used to be so friendly and always smiling. My last Flight was in December my TV was not working when I informed the flight attendant I got nothing but attitude and her answer was ""I don't know what to tell you."" After six years of using them that was my last and final time.",4/3/2014,2,5,5,2,1,3
A Hale,0,My wife and I did a trip from Perth to Brisbane (return) on business class because it was 5+ hours. The seating was no better than Economy class only a few rows behind us. Difference being we paid over $7500 for our seats and Economy would have been under $1000 for the same trip. The plane was an A330-200 and had recently been changed from Jetstar (budget airline) according to a steward on board. We do a lot of International trips out of Perth in Business Class now we know why we choose Singapore Air Air NZ or Mauritius Air. Qantas has poor seating and service.,9/19/2014,1,1,2,2,1,1
A Lim,0,My flight from LA to Manila with a stopover in Narita (Tokyo) was extremely uncomfortable in spite of the better seat pitch. The ANA gate is on the extreme edge of the LAX a 10 minute walk from Bradley terminal. Then from the gate you'll have to get a bus - another 10 minutes - to another stand-alone gate structure out in the runway area to board. The cabin was very hot and the seats have no individual air conditioning control. Throughout the 11 hrs flight the florescent light overhead was left on at all times which made it difficult to nap or sleep. The transfer in Narita was also a nightmare. There was a long line to another security check plus another 10 minutes walk and 3 floors down to board the connecting flight to Manila. I've flown several airlines to cities in US Europe and Asia and this is by far the most uncomfortable flight experience I ever had.,6/7/2012,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,1
A Haller,1,Phoenix to Oahu on Hawaiian and on return flight had a 4 hour delay due to a mechanical problem on plane. The food was awful and even the food they charged for looked awful. The positive was that staff were friendly.,5/21/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,5
A Lindau,0,SIN-MNL: While the flight itself was fine there were two major problems. First hot food on this evening flight ran out before reaching row 10 and service was painfully slow. Second I had to pay quite a lot money for my lost luggage that arrived the next day (phone calls taxis to/from the airport to pick up the luggage and even a luggage storage fee!) with no compensation whatsoever. Very poor service!,2/5/2010,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,2
A Hamid,1,Flight KL1293 from Amsterdam to Edinburgh. Had 2 kg overweight from my baggage's but that was OK. Flight departed on time. Very friendly staff and a decent snack and drink for a flight of 1 hour and 15 minutes. Didn't had to wait long for baggage so for me this flight was 9 out of 10.,9/9/2013,4,5,4,3,5,9
A Lingwood,1,Flew from Bristol to Dublin for the Giro D'Italia using Aer Lingus Regional (Aer Arran). Boarding on the outward and return was calm and civilised and the ATR aircraft clean and comfy enough for a short hop. Check-in staff and the crew onboard were polite and there was an adequate range of snacks and drinks for purchase onboard. Terminal 2 at Dublin was smart and stylish. The only drawback was the long lines for check in and bag drop on the return flight but there were a large number of people travelling that day - many returning after the Giro.,5/13/2014,4,4,4,0,4,8
A Handley,0,Travelling back from South Africa. Flight CPT to JNB delayed due to bad weather. Told that connecting flight to LHR would be held. But on getting to gate found it had left without us. Stranded in JNB airport at 10pm no SA staff no contact number nowhere to stay. Next 23 hours a complete nightmare. Unhelpful rude and arrogant SA staff at JNB.

A Little,0,"They make some very big claims about what they provide (new aircraft, personalised in-flight entertainment) and then a few weeks before going they send an email saying that we were being transferred to an airline we had never heard of. What's worse (I have three young children) is that the personalised entertainment goes and a centrally-controlled - very non-children centric - system is in. 10.5 hr flight with literally nothing for the kids to do. Thomas Cook make promises, they break promises, their customer service team don't care. All in the ""terms and conditions"" you see - think very very carefully before booking. And I write this as a lifelong customer who will never book with them again.",7/10/2015,1,1,NaN,1,1,1
A Hansen,0,Economy class from Munich to Florence on ATR 72. Aircraft clean though quite loud when seated next to the engine. After reading reviews on this site I did expect a better service. The flight attendants were smiling and friendly however they did not serve me and my girlfriend with beverages I had to request this specifically and the cookies that were the only food served on this late afternoon flight and disapointing.,5/31/2009,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,3
A Hardman,1,Flew AF from CDG to Havana 3 weeks ago. Flew Economy but bagged the two seat row at the rear of the 777. That allowed us to walk about without disturbing fellow passengers. Good leg room. Comfortable seating. Food good with additional snacks en route. Plenty of wine soft drinks and beer. Great crew and adequate entertainment. Departed CDG a little late but made up time to land Havana more or less on time. Return journey not so good. aircraft booked solid. Had no choice of seat. Food not very good due to supposed catering issue in Havana and departed 3 hours late. That decided it for us next time upgrade to business even if we have to pay more.,4/19/2014,4,4,5,5,5,8
A Lobatch,0,On September 28th at 8pm my husband and I were scheduled to depart from Toronto and travel to Israel (scheduled to arrive Sep 30 at 4am local time) with one scheduled stop in Warsaw. Arrived at the airport for 5pm to check in. By 8pm no announcements had been made in terms of any delays but our flight was not being boarded. The flight crew was 15 minutes late. When travelers started making inquiries it was announced that repairs were being made to the plane and it would be delayed for at least another hour. Boarding was not announced until 11 pm once the flight was boarded we spent another hour in the plane waiting for the flight to take off. Midway through the flight it was announced that the plane was having issues and that an emergency landing was being made in Iceland. Upon arriving in Iceland no food or hotel vouchers were handed out and no information was provided as to next steps for at least an hour. We spent no less than $70 on food coffee and water while waiting at the airport. Food vouchers were not provided until 2pm - about $15 per person which was not enough to buy much more than a drink and sandwich. Information about the flight to Warsaw was not provided for 3-4 hour after landing with no definitive instructions as to when another plane would be available. We missed the day that we planned to spend in Warsaw and also the connecting flight from Warsaw to Tel-Aviv Israel. Once we finally arrived in Warsaw we were thankfully given hotel taxi vouchers and boarding pass to Tel-Aviv through Moscow. In Moscow we spent roughly another 4 hours at the airport and another $100 between the two of us for food (no vouchers were provided). From Moscow we finally caught a flight to Tel-Aviv arriving in Israel 20 hours later than expected - 12am local time on Oct 1. Overall we were extremely disappointed with the service received - 3 lay overs instead of the scheduled 1 - and the lack of communication between the airline and travelers. We missed 2 days of our trip.,11/6/2013,1,4,2,1,2,1
A Harnett,0,Very very disappointed with Finnair. I've flown them on the same route Helsinki to Bangkok in business class twice before and enjoyed the experience. Truly a 4 star airline. Sad to say that is no longer the case. The plane was an older Airbus A340-300. The seats are not 180 degrees so difficult to sleep. The entertainment system was very poor. A small screen and less than 20 movies on offer. The food and the wine were the worst part. Two reds both 2012 and hardly drinkable. The food is worst than AA DL and UA and that's saying something. Have they put an accountant in charge of food service? The staff however were very good.,10/5/2014,1,3,1,1,4,NaN
A Lopes,1,Had a business class flight from Milan to Lisbon (1/10/13) was very nice. The cabin crew were friendly and always helped. The food was good for airline meals. Very efficient serving. No problem with the luggage. Got back to Zurich on 9/10/13 again business class. Very nice service as described before always refilled the glasses. The priority luggage is always the first which comes out. I always travel with TAP when I go to Portugal they still maintain a certain high lever which is very satisfactory.,10/10/2013,5,5,4,3,4,9
A Harris,1,Sydney - Phuket return in Business. The business class is competitively priced and you get what you pay for. Cabin crew a bit hit and miss ranging from very over familiar to the lacking any interest at all. Seats were flat bed but skinny and the entertainment was fair but limited. Food was the real disappointment when compared to other business class. I think you can compare as equal to business class Korean Air China Air etc but it in no way compares to the catering on airlines such as Qantas or Singapore. If a special fare on V Australia came my way I would travel again but all in all I think it would be hard decision to travel V Australia business if I could even get a premium economy seat on a premium airline with a better timetable.,1/19/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,5

A Harvey,0,Travelled recently Auckland-Guangzhou-London return. While this trip was very competitively priced and we were quite happy with the level of seat/bed comfort we were disappointed with the English language skills of the cabin crew who were very willing to be of service but often simply couldn't understand us. The meals were interesting and generous in quantity but there was virtually no choice of alcohol with our dinner and it wasn't offered until we asked. There also seemed to be no comprehension of a simple western breakfast: muesli yoghurt fruit and a hot cup of tea or coffee. But our biggest complaint was that on the leg from Guangzhou to Auckland the business class cabin was full of men who coughed burped snored sniffed and hoiked into their napkins to the extent that even with ear plugs firmly in place we could not sleep. Dreadful.,5/15/2013,3,4,3,2,4,5
A Luffman,1,Just returned from Tenerife to Luton on 11th Jan and outward flight no problems at all as on A320 with extra leg room and older type seats (cloth) which reclined. Service and comfort fine. However return flight was on a A321 which looked as if it had just been refitted with leather type seats with no recline action and despite again having extra leg room turned out to be the most uncomfortable flight I have been on. Virtually no padding anywhere on the seat arm rest shorter than the norm and seat squab appeared to be shorter as well which added to the discomfort. I wasn't the only one to complain to on board staff and by the response they have had many more! I would say 2 hours is about the limit that one could endure so 4- 5 hours is really a pain in the butt! Flown with Ryanair and Easyjet to same place and they were much better for the comfort factor. Just hope Monarch do not refit all planes with same seats! Apart from this aspect staff and food etc fine and not constantly pestered.,1/14/2014,4,1,4,1,4,7
A Hassan,0,My flight was last week between AUH-ISB. Apart from the inefficient ground staff to the lethargic cabin crew the unkempt interior and bland food they managed to lose my luggage as well.

A Heffner,0,"I do not plan on flying Frontier again. Cannot confirm seats prior to check-in unless you pay however no one explains this. Thus my husband 3 year old and I were all seated in different parts of the plane. Even when I paid to check in early on my return we still were separated. Everything is an additional charge. I would rather pay one price and know that I can have a confirmed seat can carry on a bag and can have one cold beverage on my flight. Flight attendants sit in the back of the plane and read a book. Not sure what the point is in having them. I booked with Amex points (a ""third party"") thus carry on luggage is extra. Pretty much everyone in our line had booked through a ""third party"" so we were all in the same boat. They make everyone have their carry on bag measured which was one of the most ridiculous things I have ever seen. This created chaos in the waiting area as multiple lines had formed and half the people didn't know what was going on.",5/1/2014,1,1,3,3,1,NaN
A Macarron,1,CPH-CDG-MIA / JFK-CDG-CPH. I upgraded to Business class on the CDG-MIA flight operated by an ageing 747-400 but everything worked just fine cabin was clean and seat comfortable. JFK-CDG was an A380-800 aircraft. We had a delay of almost 2 hours on departure from JFK due to ATC but captain kept us informed and was very apologetic. In general food was good but it could be better. Flight attendants were outstanding especially on both long haul flights they were just some of the best I have ever had. The worst was that I missed my connection at CDG and the customer service agent wanted me to wait for 6 hours when there was an available flight 1.5 hours after our late arrival. Overall very satisfied with AF. Chapeau to its cabin crew!,8/4/2013,4,4,3,4,5,7
A Hennessy,0,I booked my flight to Singapore with Virgin in March as they were a code share partner with Singapore Airlines. Never again! Their customer service was bordering on rude and were very unhelpful and failed to let me know of a schedule change they had been aware of since July until 8 days before my trip. This caused hasty re arranged travel plans and extra expense. I couldn't check in online because it was code share and was given probably the worst seats on the plane despite arriving at check in before it opened on both flights. Despite assurances from customer services at the time of booking I was refused entry to their Club House at Heathrow. I was so disappointed stressed and upset at the service I received from Virgin. I would not recommend them or use again on code share.,10/29/2013,2,5,3,3,1,1
A Macdonald,1,NCL-MLA on 31st July back 7 days later. I haven't flown Air Malta for several years and was worried standards would have dropped. In fact it hasn't changed much! Very slow check in at Newcastle and the hard sell from the check in staff to pre book our seats on return (we refused and saved Â£50). We had been told there were no free meals so the hot meal provided was a surprise and a bonus. Cabin crew were busy but helpful if you needed anything. It is a shame there is no in flight entertainment though. Several children were going stir crazy by the end of the flight.,9/20/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,7

A Macindoe,0,Travelled from London to Auckland. Having lived in London for the last 11 years I was on a flight moving back to New Zealand permanently. Flew with Singapore Airlines on SQ317 from London to Singapore and had excellent service the whole way. The flight attendants were friendly food was served quickly and was delicious trays were removed quickly and we were constantly provided refreshments. At the beginning of the flight my sister was having problems with her entertainment console so the attendant offered to re-boot the system. it was done immediately and they checked after a couple of minutes that it was working. It happened a couple of times during the flights so the attendant gave her a voucher to use towards a duty free item which was a very kind gesture. However our onwards flight from Singapore to Auckland was extremely disappointing and one of the worst long haul flights I have been on. Most of the flight attendants were very friendly (I did hear one tell a traveller that they couldn't fix their console as they were about to serve food which seemed very unhelpful) however their service was extremely lacking. Shortly after taking off we discovered that our entertainment consoles were not working properly but either continually freezing or losing sound. We pressed the buzzer for a flight attendant but after waiting 10 mins and watching them walk past us a couple of times we had to ask them in person for assistance. Rather than offer to re-boot the consoles as Singapore Airlines had done we were informed that they had been aware of the problem in Singapore but were unable to fix it until they got to Auckland. For a passenger on a 9 hour flight who has already travelled on a 12 hour flight just beforehand this was very disappointing news. We were both transferred to other seats (seated separately) however the cabin was so cold further forward that I ended up returning to my original seat. The service and quality of the food was also very disappointing. The chicken dinner we were served was very salty and the breakfast omelette was rubbery. The chicken sausage accompanying it was inedible. The attendants were also extremely slow with clearing the trays in comparison to Singapore Airlines. My sister is has Gold airpoints status so we had priority labels on our luggage however we were one of the last to get our luggage upon arrival in Auckland. Overall it was an extremely disappointing and frustrating flight. Like others who have placed reviews recently I will be very hesitant to fly Air New Zealand internationally in the future.,3/18/2015,1,3,1,1,1,1
A Mackenzie,1,SAS-CPH-LHR. SK503. Copenhagen airport was very quiet when I got there on Tuesday. SAS is constantly upgrading passenger 'self-service' which speeds up the process of getting through the airport to your gate. Their latest development is a self-service Bag Drop. Fairly simple to use. The bag is put on an unmanned luggage conveyer belt which the machine registers and weighs. The passenger then uses a bar reader gun to pick up the details from the luggage tag. The bag is then transported away. Any problems/machine errors are sorted out by a member staff on call. So now all normal pre-flight checks and documentation before security (including passport verification) can be done without staff contact and hopefully without queuing. Flight was good tea and coffee free landed nearly on time with quick baggage delivery.,12/16/2013,5,4,0,0,5,9
A Magowan,0,BHD to LHR. Flight on time flew on a modern A319 cabin crew friendly enough however legroom was practically non existant I literally didn't have room to read a magazine on my lap and actually getting to my (window) seat was tough. Overall pretty average but the lack of reasonable legroom made the flight quite uncomfortable.,9/1/2013,3,1,3,1,3,5
A Magrogan,1,It was like taking a trip back in time. Imagine a decent flight in the 1970s. Seats looked old (had ashtrays in seat arms) but comfy enough. Seat-back TV screens didn't work on 1/3 of the seats. 3 video channels (western middle eastern indian) and very old-fashioned VGA graphics on the video system menu. Food was satisfactory. Service from FAs seemed fine - courteous polite etc. But the ticket was cheap.,11/20/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,5
A Maidstone,1,Flew to Las Palmas From Newcastle on Sat 5th October and returned on the 12th October. We were highly delighted with the flight and service on board on both flights. Prompt take off and arriving early on both flights. Seats not too comfortable on a 4.5 hour journey but better than most competitors due to the extra leg room as standard. Have no hesitation in using Jet2 again in fact have already booked for next June for Cyprus.,10/16/2013,5,3,0,NaN,5,10
A Maizey,1,Our family of four recently flew from Brisbane to Honolulu return with Hawaiian Airlines. We found ourselves to be pleasantly surprised by the airline. All of our flights were on schedule the service from crew was very friendly and helpful. For example on one flight our daughter wasn't hungry at the time our first meal was served. Later in the flight we asked what food options were available to purchase and the flight attendant then returned with a spare full meal. I also liked the fact that the staff offered water numerous times throughout the flight and also collected rubbish at very regular intervals. More so than anything other flight I have been on and I really appreciated these small measures which add to the enjoyment of the flight. The seats were comfortable enough with sufficient leg room. Would like to see a little more variety in the entertainment offered (movie and television show wise). We found the check in process not to be completely straight forward. Both occasions on checking in the machines were not working correctly. We then had to be checked in by a staff member at the desk. Overall though I would definitely fly with Hawaiian Airlines again.,5/12/2015,5,4,4,4,5,8
A Makiol,1,Flew BNE-ICN-LHR return in Economy class. Overall I was very impressed with this airline. Aircraft were modern comfortable and clean on all sectors. Cabin service was wonderful regular drink runs and food was tasty. Normally 3 dinner options which is a plus. Meals served with stainless steel cutlery and hot towels distributed before dinner which is fantastic. IFE had a wide selection and ICN is the best airport for transit. All flights on time and bags available promptly. I fly regularly and Korean Air is among the best in Economy class.,6/21/2013,5,5,4,4,5,9

I sat on the upper deck which was full but this did not detract from the excellent service provided by the two dedicated crew. I chose this seat as no one has to step over your feet when they exit and it is also a fraction longer than the other seats with three windows and four compartments beneath the window to store items. I did not use the seat as a bed but used the Z position which is very good for relaxing. The food and wine choices were very good and the Club Kitchen was well stocked on the main deck for treats after dinner.,7/29/2014,4,4,4,4,4,9
A Manderson,1,"Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh City (aka Saigon). Booked online for 2 adults and one lap infant had to click a few extra smaller links to add only one checked bag for one passenger (as opposed to a package deal or the same weight bag for all passengers). Arrived 2 hours early at the check-in counter and we got served immediately. Flight wasn't full so we had the 3rd seat in our row to ourselves. Seats barely fit my 5'10"" (178cm) body. Expected it though. Cost 5 times less than Vietnam Airlines. Very friendly flight crew.",5/5/2014,5,1,1,1,5,7
A Manodori,0,"I was unhappy with the food. The quality was poor, and for an 11 hour flight there should have been two full meals. There was one meal and three minuscule snacks with water only. On the outward flight the service was excellent, but for the return it was probably the worse I have encountered.  I was disappointed and surprised that the Swiss are not always very professional.",6/27/2015,1,3,1,3,1,1
A Marathe,1,TG337 29th July. The plane was a big A330 but perhaps it was an old aircraft. There was no IFE! This is ridiculous in 2014. Before the flight took off I could only feel glad about the large amounts of leg room the old aircraft offered. I've not seen such a long leg room in any other Economy class flight. Pillows and blankets were fresh and I settled in. Since it was just a 3 hour night flight I preferred sleeping than watching movies. Hence the IFE's absence did not hurt me much. What impressed me was the extremely pleasant smiling and courteous service of the flight attendants. I had pre ordered a Hindu meal and what I got was excellent! There was chicken curry with rice and another vegetarian curry. The mango salad and the rice dessert were also perfect!,8/3/2014,5,5,5,1,5,8
A Hijmans,1,DUB-AMS. Breezy check-in through new T2 in DUB new plane flight on time and non-eventful.,3/15/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,7
A Marjoribanks,0,Well Thomas Cook you have surpassed yourself this time. Not only did you manage to delay our holiday from Glasgow to Dalaman by 8 hours on 22 May 2013 and having to bus down to Manchester to get our flight out. Now on our return journey on 3/4 June 2013 we turned up at Dalaman airport at midnight to be told that our flight back to Glasgow TCX3876 was going to be delayed by 5 hours. Now we have been informed that in fact it is going to be delayed by 14 hours. The Doncaster flight and the Newcastle flight have also been massively delayed. Absolutely shocking.,6/3/2013,1,1,2,0,3,NaN
A Hijmans,1,CDG-GIG-SSA in economy. Transatlantic leg oldish Airbus 330 with a tatty interior IFE system gave trouble throughout the flight. Reasonable but bland dinner and breakfast served. Domestic leg in A320; mini-breakfast and decent coffee served. Staff courteous.,3/27/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,6
A Hilton,1,Beijing-Amsterdam-London. The seat of economy class is comfortable which i think is the most creative part of the fight. In addition the staff on the plane and the girl who checked in for us are very nice. But the entertainment on the plane is a little monotonous.,3/25/2013,4,5,5,4,5,8
A Mark,1,Denver to Dayton to visit family in Ohio. Have flown Frontier many times before staff have always been courteous and apart from when I've flown home in the winter the flights have been on time. I have a direct flight so don't know about connecting flights.,10/21/2012,4,4,4,3,5,8
A Ho,1,Flew return between SEA and PEK on a new 787 this month. Business class cabin and seat is comfortable but not as good as top tier airlines. Cabin crew polite professional and helpful significantly improved compared to my experience several years ago but still a bit behind other Asian airlines such as EVA. Food is excellent. Ticket bought at the last minute a bit expensive at 7k+ but cheaper than Delta. For a direct flight between these two cities there are no better choices. Terminal 2 at PEK airport is the most convenient terminal easy in and out. Will have to fly this routes several times this year and will choose Hainan again. One very attractive benefit of flying Hainan business class into Beijing if you make prior arrangement via phone or website they will provide free transportation to and from PEK airport in a MB car. Enjoyed this every time considering the congestion in Beijing and poor taxi experience.,1/28/2014,3,4,5,3,4,8
A Marshall,1,ALC-SOU-ALC. Good service and almost full both ways why then is this service being withdrawn permanently (ref: Flybe website) at the end of September. Amongst 9 other routes being permanently withdrawn! All the sunshine routes are going - Palma Malaga Alicante and Faro amongst 6 domestic/euro flights. The ALC service has been running well for years please leave it alone Flybe we know times have been hard but why oh why are you moving most routes from SOU to Birmingham and Southend? Southampton and its customers have been very loyal to you and you are slowly creeping out of our local airport and leaving us without any services. I have been in touch with Southampton airport and they have responded that there are no current alternatives once Flybe leave these routes. I will rate my last ALC as very good as it is.,6/8/2014,4,5,0,0,4,9
A Hoistad,0,A good airline with good value for money. On the downside is their baggage rules 1 bag on a round trip costs approx â‚¬60 - same as the airfare. Although they cooperate with SAS and recognises Eurobonus privileges this does not apply to baggage allowance. Ground staff and crew were fantastic.,1/25/2013,4,4,0,0,5,7
A Martin,0,A very poor airline which offers poor value for money and would certainly not recommend. London-Gatwick to Madrid and back. Check-in is very slow with massive queues at the airport. Boarding ok but could have been much more organised. Their aircraft are a right mess and showing their age very uncomfortable even for a short flight. The cabin crew are not at all good.,1/14/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,1
A Horbaty,1,Edmonton to Puerto Vallarta on Dec 27 2014 and back on Jan 10 2015. Excellent especially if you have kids! They have a special family line up which is so helpful and makes the airline stand out! Overall our trip to Mexico was great flights were on time the inflight entertainment was great and we had no problem paying for the food.,3/19/2015,5,4,3,5,4,10
A Martin,1,Flew from Birmingham to Dublin for a day trip Â£15 return! Flight out was faultless boarding is much better now with allocated seating and arrived 25 minutes early. Flight back was delayed around 2 hours apparently due to 'aircraft re-positioning' but did receive a text message apologising for the delay. Was after midnight by the time we departed and everyone I think just wanted to get home or wherever. Boarding was smooth again and otherwise no problems. It certainly won't put me off flying with them again.,5/1/2015,5,4,0,NaN,4,8
A Huang,0,"Flew Melbourne to Shanghai return 2 weeks ago. Cancelled one leg of the flight as I had made other arrangements and was told that I had to repurchase tickets when I arrived for my return flight. Of course this was only after spending 5 hours at the airport calling the US and Beijing office from Shanghai. Their staff in Shanghai and Beijing had no way to change tickets, nor did they take any interest into what should have been their responsibility. So after writing an email 2 weeks ago to discuss these issues, still no response. Finally ended up calling their hotline which was directed to their US office - surprise, surprise there's nothing they are willing to do to help.",7/7/2015,3,2,2,1,2,1
A Martinez,1,I fly with them once a month SFO-SAL and back for work reasons. The times I used to fly in coach were alright. Flight attendants are dedicated to their job but only when they serve food at the beginning and end of each flight. Sometimes throughout the flight they don't come around that much. But business is a whole different thing. They are constantly asking if you need anything bringing you food and drinks. Flights are on time always. For an airline of it's range I think it's more than excellent. Of course it can't be compared to Emirates or Virgin America.,2/18/2013,4,5,4,5,4,9
A Huggett,1,SYD-MEL return into Avalon and out of Tullamarine. Jetstar do what they say on the box. I didn't expect a full service IFE or the best legroom on an A320. I hoped for on-time performance no cancellations a professional crew and they delivered. First flight was punctual the second experienced a weather-related delay that was handled well both before and during the flight with regular announcements. For the fare I was very satisfied and would use JQ again.,5/1/2015,5,4,4,0,5,9
A Mather,0,If you're looking for a company that will fly you in the least comfort at the highest price then look no further â€“ you found it. It is inconceivable that American Airlines are still flying old planes with no individual entertainment systems on their transatlantic crossing and charging more than anyone else for the privilege. They didn't even show the film they advertised. We only flew from JFK to Buffalo (with a rival company) a flight of just over an hour and they had individual entertainment screens. To add insult to injury AA ran an ad telling us all how they are adding a new plane every week to their fleet! All I can say is watch out AA when Thomson starts flying the Dreamliner from Manchester to JFK in May 2015 I do not predict a very prosperous future for them.,6/23/2014,1,1,2,1,3,1
A Huggett,1,MEL-SYD on 767-338ER using FF points to upgrade. Business lounge and Qantas Club lounge were excellent. Flight on time and service was exceptional. Staff were professional down-to-earth and genuinely helpful to some elderly passengers who required assistance. Two meal choices were available and drinks were plentiful. (There was no problem in staff knowing the difference between drinks in the event that anyone required two varieties of sparkling water to be available on a domestic flight). Seats were very comfortable perhaps a little more so than usual as the aircraft was one of the few in international configuration.,11/25/2013,5,5,5,4,5,10
A Humyani,1,Chengdu to Jiuzhaigou. Some delays due to weather. Good service and clean. Apparently does pick-up from Chengdu town for free.,12/23/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Maxton,1,Salzburg - KÃ¶ln Economy class a couple of weeks ago. Had booked this ticket about a month ago for 60 Euros. Check-in was easy friendly and efficient. The one-hour flight was uneventful. Snacks and drinks sold on board at a fair price. The aircraft was clean and the flight attendants cordial though disengaged with passengers. On time departure and arrival. Baggage collection at KÃ¶ln was fairly quick. Great value for money. Would fly them again.,8/30/2009,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Huynh,1,NRT-SGN. Flight departed a little late but we arrived on time in Vietnam. Flight staff were very friendly and food was excellent. The aircraft was clean and seats we comfortable. I would definitely flight ANA again.,12/12/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,10
A Maynard,1,"Some boarding confusion as the flight was showing delayed 45 minutes. However it boarded on time. Not surprisingly some passengers were missing and the flight left half an hour late. Crew seemed unaware that passengers were told of a delay. Really hate the easyjet boarding process where you ""board"" on time when the aircraft is not ready - so you are stuck like cattle in a corridor for up to 20 minutes. Flight OK cabin crew a bit surly not much info from the flightdeck. OK for a short flight.",5/28/2014,4,3,3,NaN,3,7
A Illsley,0,MAD-UIO-GYE-MAD-LHR. Pre-selected seats for an additional fee several months in advance however informed a few weeks before departure that our selected seats weren't available for outbound flight. Had flown into Madrid on a BA codeshare from Heathrow and legroom was probably better than on the long haul Iberia flight. Seat on Iberia has a box which severely reduces legroom. Inflight entertainment was poor however we had prepared for this and knew about it beforehand. Food was pretty good and cabin crew were reasonably approachable. Landed in Quito 20 mins late. Return flight: At check-in they told us that our pre-reserved seats had been sold to someone else. A departure tax had been retrospectively added a cost which Iberia should have absorbed. Flight to Madrid involved a technical stop in Guayaquil. Flight between Quito and Guayaquil was delayed however the real shocker was when the plane had to turn around an hour after leaving Guayaquil and make an emergency medical landing. Significant delays were caused. When had taken off for a second time out of Guayaquil we were carrying a 4.5 hour delay. When we finally landed in Madrid we were advised that there were no available connections to Heathrow that night so we needed to overnight in Madrid to fly out the following day. Iberia agent who helped us with hotel vouchers etc. was quite helpful and had clearly exhausted all possible routes to London. Stayed overnight at a hotel at Iberia's expense and the following morning to the earliest flight back to London arriving 15 hours later than scheduled. Service was very poor will try to avoid.,8/5/2013,3,2,3,1,3,3
A Mayne,0,Smallest airline seats horrible food impossible to contact or get any satisfaction from. Flew to Vancouver from Sydney (29 hours). Had to upgrade on one flight as I simply could not fit my legs into the small space without jamming them into the seat in front. Dreading the return journey to Sydney and trying to get a seat with more leg room but most unsatisfactory. Where is the customer service comfort and pleasant experience - a thing of the past I'm afraid.,11/20/2013,1,1,2,1,2,NaN
A McAndrew,1,"Round-trip New York-Moscow in Premium Economy was excellent. No problems with /check-in, both flights were on time, cabins were clean and seats were comfortable. The crew were pleasant and helpful, food was decent but the movies available on the AVOD were rather limited. The fare I paid was very reasonable and I think the Premium Economy service is an excellent value. All in all, I was extremely satisfied with Aeroflot and definitely would fly with them again.",7/21/2015,5,4,3,3,4,8
A Ivanovski,1,It is reliable and with good connections between Balkans and Western Europe. However I always find the service on the leg between Skopje and Ljubljana to be lower quality than the leg Ljubljana- Amsterdam Ljubljana - Frankfurt etc. The crew is not so friendly and helpful they always offer tuna sandwiches (assuming that because of the Muslim travelers). I insisted on a ham sandwich and never got it. Twice on the leg Ljubljana-Skopje (or vice versa). If Adria pretends to be a quality part of Star Alliance it shouldn't distinguish among the passengers which fly Skopje - Ljubljana and those flying from Ljubljana to Western Europe.,5/26/2009,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,5
A J Cushion,1,LHR-BKK-LHR. I've used Eva for approx 10 years the inflight service has always been ok. The IFE System is ok nothing compared to Etihad or Singapore. The reclining seats in Elite are very good. The food though was the worst I've ever had on a flight. I had seat 23C on both trips. There was water orange and apple juice available throughout the flight with sandwiches and nuts brought around the once. Midway on the flight I strolled to the back of the plane to have a stretch. For the price I would always recommend Elite Class.,6/21/2012,4,4,4,2,4,8
A J Taylor,1,Hong Kong to Beijing flight was a little late leaving but made the time up. Plane was an airbus looked tired from the outside but fine inside. Some of the PA announcements were lost in translation but the crew were friendly and helpful food was OK alcohol needed to be purchased entertainment just local Chinese television. I would use them again in this part of the world.,8/1/2012,4,4,3,2,4,7
A McCoo,1,STN to KUL return. Flights on time and check-in and ground services satisfactory. The flight attendants were smiling and helpful. All extras must be either prebooked or purchased onboard but I found prices fair and reasonable. The food was neither better or worse than most other carriers. One problem the seats are very narrow. They have 9 seats across (3x3x3) in an A340 and they have reduced the heights of these seats to give the impression that they are wider than they are. The outcome - you need to be very friendly with your neighbour. That being said if they keep their prices below their competitors I will certainly use them again.,8/2/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,7
A Jackson,1,First Class LAX to HNL-LIH. First class was mediocre. The first class cabin was quite crowded seats weren't that large. Nothing was electric on the seat an older manual style. The entertainment consisted of small video units passed out to each passenger -entertainment choice was terrible. The food was ok drinks were fine. The staff was exceptionally nice and the cabin was clean. It was all quite mundane and functional.,5/10/2010,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,6
A McDonnell,1,Madrid - Dublin EI 595 22/12/13. Check/baggage drop in Madrid (sub contractor) slow inefficient. Aircraft clean comfortable. Punctuality slight delay on departure arrival on time. Flight attendants efficient friendly and very professional. Greatly improved offerings of food on board at reasonable prices. Baggage delivered speedily on arrival in Dublin. Altogether excellent flight and service. They do however need to watch that they are not let down by ground handling agents.,12/25/2013,4,4,4,0,5,8
A Jain,0,Worst business class I have experienced. We flew from Sydney-Honolulu and Honolulu-Oakland and were shocked. The seats were terrible reclining just a little bit more than those in economy class and the food options for vegetarians were non-existent. We had informed them that we are vegetarian well in advance but when we reached the airport we were told that they don't have special meals for anyone even in business class so we'll have to make do with whatever they had. The lounge in Honolulu is shocking - no food just some juice and soft drinks. If you do have to fly Hawaiian do yourself a favor and save yourself a lot of money by flying economy - business class adds nothing.,3/11/2014,1,1,1,3,4,1
A McKenzie,0,Poor trip with Jetstar will be happy if I never travel with them again. Our direct flight was cancelled Sydney to Phuket and we were then sent through Sydney-Melbourne-Phuket meaning an extra few hours before we even left Australia. Once on board our Melbourne Phuket plane the seats were quite comfortable. Meal times were different we had paid and pre-ordered meals but no they had no record of that even though it was printed on our ticket. This meant we had no meals as only those prepaid and recorded were put on board. We could then purchase a toasted sandwich or pie most uninteresting and unsatisfying. The staff were less than helpful daughter had an infant and was not offered a spare cushion or any other help.,1/11/2015,2,4,2,3,2,3
A Jalandoni,1,LAX-MNL/MNL-LAX. Philippine Airlines new Business Class product which I was quite pleased with. The cabin was clean modern and fully staffed. They have the new angled lie flat seats which are quite nice. Entertainment system pretty good. The dinner service was excellent. The only glitch is the wine list - only two choices. The service in general was warm friendly and sincere. The over all in flight product is good and a great value for your money. However reservations and check in can be touched up a bit.,10/12/2009,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A McLeod,1,Really impressed with the service. Planes are really small but it's a full service and the attendants are lovely. Edinburgh to Copenhagen and back. Flights were on time and smooth. No inflight entertainment. No issue though as its less than 2 hours. Website does says online check in which isn't true so it is old fashioned counter check in. They are sorting that though.,2/4/2013,4,4,4,0,5,9
A Jamieson,0,Very poor customer communication and information in flight from Sharm el Sheikh to Edinburgh on 5/10/2013. Flight was delayed but no info provided in the terminal. Once on board could sense strange attitude amongst the cabin crew but they waited till the flight was about to leave before letting us know that we were being diverted to Newcastle because of runway work at Edinburgh. No information on why Newcastle not Glasgow which is considerably closer. No information on expected arrival time in Edinburgh taking account of bus journey from Newcastle. No decent opportunity to let people collecting at Edinburgh (taxis family) know of delay which given 02.45 arrival time was very worrying for people. No additional food or drinks provided even though the overall delay was 4 hours. During the flight the cabin crew were very inattentive instead talking with each other almost non-stop and at one point all moving to the forward area to talk. The curtain does not mask noise and for those of us near the front it was impossible to sleep due to the cabin crew being so selfish. The cabin crew kept going on about how they were affected by the outgoing flight being 1 hour late and failed to see the customer perspective since we faced a bus transfer and a 4 hour delay. They are paid to do their job which includes customer service. They made 1 trip through with the drinks trolley then each announcement focused on their offers of scratchcard duty free and then charity collection. One of the worst crews I have ever seen in action.,10/7/2013,1,2,2,1,1,NaN
A McNicol,1,BKK-SIN on a full A320. Check-in about 20 minutes not bad for Jetstar most importantly on time despite a full plane. All this for much less than the full service carriers. No frills but you get where you are going efficiently and this is all I want.,3/25/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
A McNicol,1,QF81 SYD-SIN on a full A330. On time from Sydney early into Singapore. Service the usual Qantas blend of informal but professional attention. All in all a consistent product that met my expectations.,12/29/2013,5,4,4,4,5,8
A Jankowsky,0,Copenhagen check-in terminal printed boarding pass with no seat assigned. Bag drop off resulted in questioning about contents of bag - fishing equipment apparently a problem so bag brought to special bag desk who are confused and say that fishing equipment is no problem and even frozen fish is fine. Boarding pass rejected at gate - new pass grudgingly issued with comment 'you must have done it incorrectly'. Given the simplicity of the check-in terminal there is nothing you can really do wrong and a pass should not be issued without an assigned seat. Flight delayed slightly but otherwise fine if basic with no entertainment system. Bag lost en-route to Dublin. SAS baggage help desk in Dublin does not answer phone calls or return calls when messages are left. Rang the SAS helpline and they can't help - tell me to ring baggage help desk. 3 days later the bag arrives. Not good enough.,8/14/2014,2,2,1,1,1,2
A Mehta,0,Travelled by AI to HYD. Aircraft was VT-SCB in the Indian livery. Plus points: Check in was a breeze. Flight departed on time. Minus points: Aircraft was unclean. Crumbs on the tray table the side panels looked as if the last time they had been cleaned was during the Airbus delivery. All that pax were given was 2 cheap pieces of biscuit. The spring rod from the seat pocket was broken and was poking my knee on for the entire flight. For a full flight I did not have an option to change my seat. Never again with Air India.,6/1/2014,2,1,1,1,3,3
A Jason,0,Prince George to Vancouver on Flight WS3282 no issues at all. Second part flight from Vancouver to Las Vegas WS1788. A major delay and staff member onboard was unfriendly with a poor attitude. Third part Las Vegas to Vancouver WS1789. Flight crew on that flight were unfriendly and seemed annoyed when asked questions. We had originally booked and paid more to connect in Vancouver to Flight WS3293 with a 1h 20 min connection so naturally we felt a little rushed but felt this was ample time to connect flights. Upon arriving at the gate it took forever to get all the passengers off. We had asked for a cart to speed things up from the plane but were denied and told to speak with the Westjet desk outside of Customs. We rushed to Customs and were put through very quickly by CBSA. Because of the Customs rules we had to wait for our luggage which took well over 25 minutes to collect. We went to the Westjet connection desk we were told we had been re-booked for a later flight at 2130hrs. When we spoke with a Westjet attendant she couldn't figure out why we were re-booked in the first place without our knowledge as everything landed on time. Flight back to Prince George was fine flight wise. Like the flight down and back no entertainment or offer of entertainment or even a mention of no entertainment.,11/20/2014,1,3,3,1,1,NaN
A Mendonca,1,London - Mumbai - Goa in Business Class. The London-Mumbai business class section was sold out. However the staff were very attentive and professional. Breakfast and dinner were excellent with a good selection on the menu. I highly recommend the Indian food! The seats were very comfortable and I slept well. I had a 6 hour wait at the Mumbai airport. I took my time to admire some of the art at the incredibly beautiful international terminal. The transfer from the international terminal to the domestic terminal was easier than in past years. I was disappointed t learn that Jet Airways does not have a business class lounge at the domestic airport so my wait was not as comfortable as I would have liked. The service on the Mumbai-Goa flight was simply superb! We were in the air for just over half an hour and were served a full breakfast. I will certainly fly Jet Airways business class again.,4/20/2015,5,5,5,4,5,10
A Jenkins,0,"We flew the new JFK-CAN route then transferred to a Beijing flight. It was the worst airline I've experienced. Incompetent and unprofessional ground crew who have zero problem solving skills. Sour-faced service from the flight attendants their English skills were inexcusably bad. The food was awful it wasn't served frequently enough they were stingy with drinks. The transit experience in CAN (Baiyun) is long and uncomfortable. On the return trip it was late at night. We had to walk for 20 minutes. The ""free"" shuttle wasn't running. There was no one around to help. I strongly suggest that the elderly and disabled avoid this airline. Once you make it through all the immigration and security checks you are stuck in a tacky area with limited food and drinks and extortionate prices which are completely out of line with what other ""international"" transit terminals charge. The only positives: decent in-flight entertainment the plane was new; the landings for the international segments were very smooth.",9/1/2014,2,2,1,4,1,1
A Menyasz,0,23 Dec 2013 Toronto (YTZ) - Ottawa (YOW). Porter Airlines is one of the few airlines you can count on to be delayed every single time you fly them. It is completely unacceptable that they constantly make their customers late and offer nothing to make up for any such inconvenience. Even just while sitting in the lounge for several hours waiting for my flight as other airlines had no issues getting their flights off the ground on time Porter cancelled two flights and suggested that those customers fly with another airline (and pay the exorbitant fees they were charging at the gate) just to get home on time for Christmas. In fact I was just notified that my return leg of the flight I am reviewing has also just been delayed. Flyer beware.,12/30/2013,2,3,4,1,3,1
A Jimenez,1,TK33 Economy IAH to SSH via Istanbul on November 21 and again November 30 2014. TA exceeded my expectations in all aspects of the flight. Food on the flight was abundant and of a very good quality. Staff were attentive and helpful throughout the whole flight. Inflight entertainment was varied with pretty good choices. Seat was ok but after a 14 hour flight everything seems a little uncomfortable I guess. The only negative was perhaps the craziness encountered at Istanbul Ataturk airport and the uncaring attitude of people at the airport. TA is pretty good value for money and I will not hesitate to use it again in the near future.,12/31/2014,5,4,5,5,4,9
A Johns,0,Flew to Cancun on 5th August TOM28. There were 3 of us 2 adults and one 7 year old. Having missed out on a holiday in 2013 we decided to treat ourselves and upgrade to Premium. I cannot fault the outbound flight. Priority check-in with separate baggage check-in and separate security passport control all taking no more than ten minutes or so. Staff - friendly and attentive got customer care spot on. Came round with drinks trolley numerous times. They were happy to make conversation and made a fuss of the kids. Food was good with a very good choice - sparkling wine or orange juice was offered pre-flight which was a lovely touch. Separate meals for the kids. Snacks offered with drinks and some small chocolate bars offered. The individual mini desserts were particularly good and the inclusion of an afternoon tea prior to landing was again well thought out. The plane: Nice wide leather seats with moveable head rests lots of leg room with pop up leg rest blankets pillows and a travel bag with toothbrush eye patches ear defenders all a nice touch. The actual plane noise was minimal with auto dimming on the windows. Inflight entertainment: Good selection of movies for adults and kids nice quality headphones handed out once seated there were also music channels some interactive games and some drama and comedy channels a pretty good selection with some quite new films. Now the bad the return. 19 Aug TOM 29. We were so disappointed after having a fantastic family holiday no welcome onboard. All extras that had been handed out to us on the inbound flight - head phones etc were just thrown on your seat The three women and one guy barely managed a smile let alone spoke to customers. I was reading my magazine and I had a menu thrust over the top. Food trays were whisked away swiftly. The main meal was a poor reflection on the outbound meal. Main course was as uninteresting the dessert was written on the menu as a chocolate indulgence - well it was one squirt of vanilla whip and one chocolate whip on a piece of sponge. Drinks offered with meals. We did not see the waiting staff for about 6 hours as they eventually pulled their curtains and were not seen till breakfast not even to check everyone was ok or offer water etc. There were supposed to be two different inflight entertainment menus one outgoing one return. Well we had exactly the same films and offer on both journeys.,9/1/2014,1,5,2,3,1,NaN
A Merchant,1,Flew Vancouver-Calgary and Edmonton-Toronto. Efficient check-in procedure with Westjet staff on hand to help if needed.

A Michel,1,Paris to Abu Dhabi - July 3 2013 and back on July 27 2013. Flying with Jet Airways from Paris to India we had a stop to Abu Dhabi so that the long flight was endorsed by Etihad partnership. Such a great company in economy class! We were well placed close to the window great seat comfort plane quite new great stewards service. My headphone wasn't working and the hostess gave me a new one within 5 mins with apologies. Good food and good vegetarian food. Good choice of entertainment. Flight was quiet. Cabin was not cold at all and we were glad for such good comfort.,8/12/2013,5,5,5,5,5,10
A Johnson,0,Sydney-Ballina-Sydney. Was really impressed with both flights. The small cabin was not an issue on 80min flights. Seats comfortable and adequate room. Only recommendation is to not take too much carry-on baggage as there is limited storage space. Both ways the flight attendants were helpful and happy. Great addition to both flights were the FAs who stopped to have a chat to passengers after they had served the small snack - either a museli bar or packet of shapes and either tea/coffee/water. On the flight up we were delayed 90mins due to mechanical problems. The weather in Byron meant some baggage had to be taken off so extra fuel could be put on board in case of diversion. Staff were helpful and dealt with it in a professional manner sending the remaining bags up on the afternoon Virgin flight. I'd recommend REX over Virgin and Jetstar. I payed less than half for the REX airfare than what the other two were offering and was twice as happy flying with them.,1/21/2009,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,5
A Mihai,1,DUB to BVA on the morning flight. Bought the ticket online 2 weeks ahead and it was cheaper that the taxi ride to the airport. Did not expect much but I was quite impressed with them. I work as Cabin Crew so I do know how to travel with a low cost carrier. I paid the extra 10eur for a seat on the first row. Extremely comfortable and thanks to the included priority boarding hassle free experience in the airport. My bag was a bit bigger (the side which was supposed to be just 20cm was slightly larger did not experience any problem). Staff extremely polite and professional both in the airport and in the air. Flight landed 5min early in BVA so absolutely nothing to complain about. I paid 23eur for a flight ticket and got early to my destination on board a brand new Boeing 737 aircraft (the aircraft had been delivered only a week before). I will definitely fly Ryanair again.,10/1/2014,5,5,4,NaN,5,10
A Miller,0,My flight to Colorado Springs with connection at Denver was delayed which in turn made me miss my connection flight. They showed no empathy towards my situation but were rude in suggesting that the only option was to fly the next day at 8 am. We were told that they were holding flights when in fact my connection flight left 7 minutes earlier than suppose to. This is the last time I fly Frontier. I was told by another flyer that this happens way to frequent and he was driving from Denver to Colorado Springs. This was my first time flying alone to this airport. They have made this a bad experience. This airline needs to get their act together.,9/9/2012,1,4,0,0,2,1
A Johnson,0,KC to Denver- my flight was due to leave at 8.30 am. At 9.00 it was announced that the flight was delayed and more announcements would follow. Announcement at 9.30 am the flight will be at 10.30. At 10.30 it was announced that at 1.00 it would be announced if the flight would be cancelled or rescheduled for later that day. Also was told to be thinking about booking a different flight just in case. I went to the ticket counter and asked about a different flight. I was given a flight to Chicago on a different airline and would catch a flight from there to Denver. I went to the gate of the different airline and noticed that I landed in O'Hare but flew out of Midway. I asked the person at the gate about it. He checked it and said to return to the ticket counter. By that time the line was very long and only 1 person was handling that canceled flight. 4 hours later I got to the counter. I had to stay the night and flew to Dallas to catch a flight to Denver from there. I lost 2 days of work extra parking fees.Told they would send me a $75 voucher. They can not pay me to fly Frontier again.,10/16/2013,1,3,1,0,1,NaN
A Milligan,1,LHR-LIS-EWR. A lot better than expected great food and plenty of drink on offer. No champagne on the New York flight good breakfast on the first leg. Great lounge in Lisbon if rather small - if price is right I would book them again.,4/5/2012,4,4,5,4,4,8
A Milossavlyevich,0,A3 930 Athens to Cairo. Service bland and erratic uncomfortable thin seats food inedible and in minuscule quantities. Gate agent checking my visa requirements for 15 minutes. A real disappointment.,4/14/2015,2,1,1,1,2,2
A Johnston,1,Flew from Sharm El Sheikh to CAI on Em-170 and CAI to CAN on 777-300 in Business Class. Both flights were on time and departed with no problems. First flight was full second flight about 60% full. Only 5 of the 49 business class seats occupied. From CAI to CAN it was overnight flight so I did not eat. Slept for 6.5 hrs in the flat bed seats very comfortable. Breakfast was basic everything served at once on a tray. Very happy with the trip and the price.,2/13/2012,4,4,3,3,3,8
A Milossavlyevich,1,SAW to ASR. Plane older but clean staff courteous. Have no illusions - service at Pegasus is plain and correct. No ads no hidden fees - just transport. The airport they operate from (Sabiha Gokcen) is far from the city and has its own separate issues.,3/27/2013,5,5,0,0,5,7
A Jones,1,LHR-DXB-BKK / BKK-DXB-LHR. My first experience with Emirates and it was an impressive one. All flights on time with no issues with connecting flights. Outward connection at Dubai for 3 hours was a bit too long followed by another 6 hour flight to Bangkok would have meant feeling shattered on arrival but it was a brand new 777-300 and it was empty I counted 10 pax in our section so climbed on the 4 seats and slept uninterrupted until woken for landing. How anyone can not be impressed by the A380 beggars belief. We had seats in the rear on outward front section on return and it's incredibly quiet compared to the 747! Plenty of leg room (I'm 6ft) and comfortable seats. Food quality was good too I've flown Thai quite a few times and the food as been excellent every time for me Emirates was not far behind. Plenty of drink runs and flight attendants were helpful and courteous. The ICE system needs hardly any mention it's simply superb especially on the A380. Online check-in and seat selection made this experience an effortless one. We landed at LHR at a busy time early Friday evening we were off the aircraft through border control and collected our luggage within 50 minutes! All in all can't fault Emirates. Would recommend and certainly fly again.,9/17/2014,5,5,5,5,5,10
A Miralles,0,We flew Air Memphis from Milan to Hurghada with our 4 month old son. The baby pushchair was broken while handled by airline staff and we are still waiting for an answer from Air Memphis who play dead. Apart from this behaviour food terrible staff unpleasant and unhelpful. No baby cot like any decent airline - even though we had been promised one - on a night flight meant that baby slept on our laps and we stayed awake.,10/26/2010,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Mitchell,1,Gatwick to Malta return Club Class. Both flights on time and inflight food and drinks service very good. Few business class passengers on both flights though. Servisair lounge at Gatwick was disappointing however La Valette Club ay Malta airport was modern with excellent selection of drinks.,10/9/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Jopson,1,Recently flew Qantas/Jetconnect from Brisbane to Auckland QF125 this flight leaves Brisbane at 6.45pm arriving into Auckland at around 11.50pm. Online check-in was easy and when we dropped our bags at check-in the staff were friendly and very nice. Once onboard the crew were welcoming and friendly as always with the Kiwi Spirit was sitting in row 15 leg room was good for myself and seat was comfortable meals were great and options for Beverages were just the same. Would recommend Qantas across the Tasman any day with it being one of the only Full Service Airlines that operate from Australia to New Zealand and these flights are all operated by New Zealanders so they are always friendly and welcoming with a Smile.,11/4/2013,5,5,5,5,5,10
A Mogie,1,Flew Sydney to Honolulu then Honolulu to Las Vegas and back to Honolulu on A330 overall flights were good especially the international legs but the seats on the 330 are far too hard. The flight attendants were very good we then flew Honolulu to Brisbane on old 767 but actually this aircraft was very comfortable and would be my preference over the 330 every time.,6/2/2014,3,3,4,3,5,6
A Moon,0,I would just like to state that our journey to and from Bangkok with Royal Jordanian was so disappointing. Despite the fact we didn't get the seats we had booked online as it was a different jet to the one specified when reserving online plus at the check in desk (this was mentioned to on board staff and no one cared) and that all the seats were damaged or in bad condition the staff were so rude. We boarded two flights outbound RJ112 and RJ12 17th Dec 14 and returning home 5 Jan 15 RJ183 and RJ111 (although staff on the RJ111 were slightly more polite) and the service was awful. I wouldn't use them again nor recommend RJ.,1/19/2015,1,1,1,3,1,NaN
A Joseph,0,Toronto to Trivandrum by business class. On the plane from Toronto to Abu Dhabi the cabin staff were more interested in selling duty free goods than serving passengers any food. I had to ask the flight steward to serve breakfast to my son who was awake for at least 45 minutes. The trip from Abu Dhabi to Trivandrum was good. The lounge was good but Terminal 1 was crowded and poorly organized. There was a long line up to check in and business class passengers were not given any priority. On our trip back the 13 hour flight from Abu Dhabi to Toronto was a disaster. They only served dinner and did not serve any food afterwards in business class! I had to ask for a cup of coffee which arrived minutes before landing in Toronto. I don't think I will be travelling Etihad again unless they change their service to passengers.,1/6/2014,3,4,3,3,3,4
A Moore,0,Bergerac to Exeter. Like another reviewer we were booked on the evening flight from Bergerac to Exeter on Saturday 26th May. When we booked in our luggage we were told that the flight was being diverted to Birmingham due to (quote) 'staffing difficulties' and that we would be transported to Exeter by coach. We subsequently found out that the Birmingham flight had been due to leave at 3.30 pm so passengers for that flight had been waiting for 5 hours. When we boarded the plane (Exeter and Birmingham passengers) it was about 3/4 full so patently obvious that the real reason why the flights had been amalgamated was to save on Flybe costs with absolutely no consideration for their customers. Instead of arriving in Exeter at 9 pm we arrived at 1.15 am. The introduction to Flybe's Passenger Charter under the slogan Making Flying Better includes the promise of a safe reliable and punctual journey. Safe maybe but certainly not reliable or punctual ! After the extras Flybe add on they are not a cheap Airline but you can expect a cheap and shoddy service although the harassed Flybe staff at Bergerac Airport and the cabin crew did their level best to re- assure passengers. Will we be flying again with Flybe? Most definitely not.,6/4/2012,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Joyce,1,Dublin - Abu Dhabi - Bangkok return economy March 2014. Frequent Flyer and Etihad gold card holder. Etihad are a good but no longer great airline. All flights were punctual. The lounge in Dublin is fantastic. All flight sectors were very busy. Food onboard was OK. The food service onboard seems to take an extortionate amount of time. Also Etihad leave the main lighting on for too long on red eye flight. They should make better use of the mood lighting for those that want to sleep. The seat pitch on the A330 was not good and I could not sleep. The Boeing 777 aircraft with 10 abreast seating and narrow aisles feels cramped but easier to sleep on. The crew were friendly and professional on all sectors. They currently appear to be more interactive and helpful with passengers. I was impressed as I was greeted by name on one sector. IFE is good. Etihad now seem to have a policy of boarding almost an hour before scheduled departure which seems excessive to me. We were sitting on the tarmac after boarding for a least 30minutes on all sectors and I was one of the last few to board. There are still issues with the landing slot in Dublin airport in the morning as no stands are available to park at. Another delay after a 8 hour flight.,4/8/2014,4,3,4,3,5,8
A Morgan,0,"Hamburg-Brussels-Warsaw. Worst flying experience ever and I am quite experienced with low-cost carriers. The Hamburg-Brussels flight was late and they didn't bother to inform us until 1 minute before the gates were supposed to be closed. Thankfully Brussels-Warsaw was also late and it the only reason I made it to the gates on time. This and that I was able to run and without kids. On this flight there was not enough space to put my bag in overhead compartment designated for my seat. I asked FA to help me and she just said ""You will have to keep it under your seat"" without even bothering to check if any space was available. We did made it on time to Warsaw but it was horrible experience. If I missed flight to Warsaw I would have to spend night in a hotel. Never again! I'd rather fly Ryanair!",12/31/2014,3,1,1,1,1,2
A Kadubiec,0,I fly a lot and this had to be the worst flight I've ever been on. The flight was late taking off when I boarded the plan I found out they had given my seat away. I then had to stand at the front of the plane until the entire flight boarded so they could find me an unused seat to which they said 'I'm sure you'll be able to stay on this flight'. Afterwards due to a mishap with my belongings I had to call the airline company several times. Not only did I have to wait 15-20 mins each time to speak to someone they would then proceed to tell me complaints and questions can't be made over the phone.,9/10/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,1
A Morris,1,Service was good out of PBI plane looked a little tired but seats comfortable. Upon arriving in BWI connecting flight to LGA was delayed 2.5 hrs. They need to improve their LGA service. Got there but late. Still a great airline.,5/17/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,5
A Kapoor,0,It wasn't just the shabbiness of the cabin poor leg room lack of inflight entertainment delays but more especially the sense that Kuwait Airways doesn't care at all for the comfort welfare or opinions of its passengers. It exists simply to transport people from one place to another at a cheap fare. Not a great feeling when you're on a transatlantic flight for 7 hours. My husband and I booked a round trip flight to from New York to London and back before reading any customer reviews. I read them after we had already made the booking and then dreaded the trip. To my surprise the flight from New York was fine. The plane wasn't crowded and a kind steward moved us into an empty bulkhead seat so we would have more leg room. There were no undue delays. We didn't mind the lack of inflight entertainment or alcohol on board and I was prepared to give Kuwait Air higher marks. Then we flew home. After going through security at Heathrow in London we found when we got to the gate for our flight that we had to line up and go through another security check by Kuwait Air staff. The line was delayed when they thought a French woman didn't have a visa for the US and went away for several minutes to check on this. My husband was next in line and they didn't bother to check his backpack in which he had accidentally left a tube of antiseptic cream. 300 people many with children had to go through this line. Once past this there were no toilet facilities or drinking water available in the waiting area. On board over an hour later we were handed earphones then snacks then ordered to shut our shades. Then 2 hours later ordered to open our shades wash our faces hand back the wash cloths without delay eat dinner. No one had the nerve to disregard all these commands issued by a tiger lady who never smiled or spoke politely to any one except some young Arab passengers blocking the aisle while she did so. Almost no one left their seats until nearly the end of the flight. No assistance was offered to mothers with crying children. As we left the plane I asked a steward at the door what the earphones were for. He said with a broad smile that they were for the inflight entertainment! I just laughed at that. That was my inflight entertainment. I put it all down to a cultural experience until then foreign to me. But I don't really need a cultural educational experience when I'm in a plane. So never again.,5/17/2014,2,3,4,1,2,2
A Motetti,1,Buenos Aires-Rio de Janeiro. Business class with my wife and 2 sons. Airport staff were very helpful. The cabin was clean but my TV screen didn't work. The seat was comfortable but my wife's didn't work. The service aboard was poor and so was the food. Before departing the hostess offered only warm water. The inflight entertainment was non existent. Nevertheless the service for South American standards was acceptable.,11/14/2011,2,4,1,2,3,5
A Mudgal,0,Pune to Chennai return. Flown for the first time with them and found them okay. Planes were new and clean. Both flights were on time. FAs well groomed and do a good job. Food served was not free and was more of a snack. For the fare they charge you its a very good airline to fly with in India.,5/23/2008,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,4
A Karunaharamoorthy,1,I flew from Berlin Tegel (TXL) to Sofia (SOF) and return (A320 and A319 respectively). Water bottles were put on the seat before take-off. The service included a small sandwich (nothing fancy but the taste was ok) a piece of chocolate tea/coffee and a soft drink beer or vine. The staff was quite friendly and I felt welcomed on board. Both flights had a delay of around 15 minutes which is perfectly normal. The only drawback was that both planes were old and the seats rather worn. But overall I had a pleasant experience and will fly with Bulgaria Air again.,4/4/2015,0,0,0,0,0,9
A Munoz,0,"Barcelona - Lisbon - Barcelona. The delays on both flights cost me a lot seams this is a daily problem. On the way back I arrived in Barcelona 3 hours late. The online check in only works by Phone call. Aircraft from Barcelona to Lisbon was dirty additionally they have redefined the meaning of ""meal"" to refer to a minuscule triangle of dry bread and a small drink. Very bad on refills only got 15cl of cheap orange juice. Staff should be more friendly.",6/4/2014,1,2,1,1,1,1
A Mura,0,TLL-MXP First experience with Estonian Air. Good flight even if the plane seems old (Boeing 737-500) and not so confortable. They've introduced e-tickets only several months ago. Staff polite and present. Prices seems quite high.,8/26/2008,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,3
A Kaushik,1,Travelled Y class from SYD to BNE on a 737-800. Flight was on time and quite comfortable. Ordered vegetarian meal was surprised to be served a hot meal on such a short flight. Quality of the food was so-so. Best part of the catering was the Lindt chocolate they handed out after the meal. Crew were friendly and obliging. Would certainly travel with them again.,12/18/2014,3,3,2,1,4,9
A Murray,0,7 hour delay from Manchester to Palma airport flight FR3441. Checked baggage in and no mention of delay 5 minutes later through security it stated on the flight boards delayed to 00.40 original flight time 17.35. No one at the airport to talk to only a phone at the help desk and then you could not get through. Eventually did speak to someone who did not explain the reason for the delay and explained that food vouchers would be given out at 20.30. Really poor customer service in my opinion. Hiding behind a telephone. Other families with very young children were told that the children under 5 not entitled to food vouchers. Do under 5s not eat and drink? Although this is a first for me with Ryanair the 10 hours we were actually stuck in the airport as no one would let you out was exhausting and for that reason along with the rubbish customer care I will never fly with them again. Avoid.,5/11/2014,1,2,0,NaN,2,NaN
A Kegel,1,ZRH-DUS-MIA and return in business class. Short flights okay (only coach class but they kept the seat next to me free). Business class seats fully flat really great if you sleep on the side (otherwise might be a bit short) staff extremely friendly meals rather uninspired (I had a pre-ordered vegetarian meal). Entertainment has a nice selection however I slept most of the time. Would fly with Air Berlin in business class.,12/1/2014,5,5,2,4,4,9
A Nakakes,0,AUH-PRG-AUH. The flights were good and on time crew were attentive. The seat in business class was rather new but dated design and not that comfortable. This is substandard seat even for a medium haul flight these days. The food was unacceptable. There was only cold food on the PRG-AUH flight. Even though it was a night flight there should be a choice of hot food. The guy in front of me had to ask an attendant to heat up his sandwiches. The airline allowed 24 hours internet check in but it was useless because there was no baggage drop-off point. You could really check in only a few hours prior to your flight at Prague airport CSA homebase? I will not fly with CSA again.,10/14/2012,4,3,2,3,3,3
A Kelly,0,Booked our flight and seats from LBA to Cyprus - paid for extra leg room and the 6 seats together arrived at the airport to find our seats had been reallocated. Jet2 agreed to give us our original booked seats but when we got on the flight and our original seats were taken and the air crew were a waste of time. I will never use Jet2 again. Was a frequent flyer but we stopped as it is always the same excuse.,8/12/2012,1,3,0,NaN,1,1
A Naskali,1,I flew SIN-HEL on 23 November returning on 9 December. I transferred from a Silk Air flight at Changi. The person at the transfer desk at Changi came across rather terse but not unfriendly. Flights departed on time both ways. On the return journey baggage drop at Helsinki was smooth no queuing at all. Cabin crew couldn't have been more efficient and pleasant. I had vegetarian meals which were surprisingly tasty. Seat comfort was as good as you get on long-haul flights. The in-flight movie selection appeared rather limited so I opted for reading instead. Overall very pleased with the flights and the service.,12/18/2014,4,4,5,3,4,8
A Keogh,1,MEL-SEL-CTS then NRT-SEL-MEL. Cannot fault this airline great entertainment lots of movies and games. Comfy seats very attentive staff food was very good for economy.

A Nevriana,1,I took 2 VN flights (BKK-HAN and HAN-SGN) during the past few days. Flight to HAN: We experienced lots of turbulence during the flight yet the pilot managed to land the plane smoothly. Flight to SGN: it was quite spacious for a domestic flight yet the cabin crew should be more assertive in reprimanding the passengers who didn't obey the flight safety instructions. The in-flight entertainment didn't work but the magazine provided was quite entertaining. Should provide wider selection of in-flight meals.,5/1/2014,3,3,2,2,3,7
A Khraizat,1,DTW-BEY. I didn't like the comfort of the seats - not much leg room. I don't recommend the food. Entertainment was excellent. Overall staff very friendly and attend to your needs and wants.,10/11/2012,3,1,3,5,3,5
A Nganga,1,My flight check-ins were seamless. I have never flown on an airline with so much legroom for the standard coach or 3rd class! Clean and comfy seats nice variety of channels. Wish they had complementary meals for the flights that are 5+ hrs long. Flew from BUF-SFO everything went smoothly on time departures. Flights from SFO-BOS BOS- JFK and JFK-BUF were delayed and they apologized for that. Customer service in BOS was good but customer service in JFK wasn't good at all. Either way I'd still recommend this airline to family and friends.,12/17/2013,4,5,3,4,3,8
A Kilvert,0,Booked flight and hotel with Travelbag and was horrified to discover that I was flying with AA! We flew economy from Heathrow to Miami Miami to San Jose. Check-in was good and we got good exit row seats on the first flight. Second flight we got bad seats and rude staff. Return journey again we got good exit row seats but had more bad staff does AA specialise in them? Not as bad as I thought but due to rude staff I won't be rushing to fly with them again.,1/26/2015,3,4,5,1,1,5
A Nicholson,1,First time flying with Aegean Airlines from FRA to ATH on a Lufthansa codeshare and couldn't be happier. Nice to have inflight infotainment on a short haul flight and not bad food better than Air Canada. No delays on time and cabin crew were nice. Only downside was that there was no seat-back monitors which many airliners are upgrading to and seats are sort of stiff.,12/23/2013,4,4,4,4,5,10
A King,1,12-15 September 2013 - MAN-BRU-MAN. Outbound flight was on behalf of Flybe Dash 8 - delayed by 40 mins plane interior bright. Flight attendants very helpful complimentary drinks and snacks provided on return journey also. Pleasantly surprised with seats - wide and plenty of leg room. Downside is that seats were bookable upon check - in online 24hrs prior to departure. Return journey from Brussels - Manchester - the departure gate was changed twice and on both occasions only notified 20 mins before we were due to depart. It was our first time using online check in - smooth transaction good inflight service. I would fly with Brussels Airlines in the future.,9/18/2013,3,4,4,0,4,6
A Niphadkar,1,Mumbai to Kuala Lumpur return. Economy seat comfortable but after 2 hours legs get a bit uncomfortable as minimum space for feet. Food - we pre-booked vegetarian meal they gave us curry and small mineral water bottle. Food tasty but quantity of food very small. Recommend Air Asia and its very cheap.,2/17/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
A Kirkman,0,Flew MAN-AUH-KUL then MEL-AUH-AUH-MAN. First flight delayed 4 hours missed our connection to KUL we was put on a flight later that night this wasn't any good to us as we had booked another airline to fly us to SYD and would have missed that flight. We was put on a coach to Dubai and had to fly MH DXB-KUL really good service on MH. We made our connection with 13 min to spare. Service was very slow and if you pressed your call button it was just ignored food wasn't that good only good part was AUH-MAN. The staff on this flight were really good. Not many new films on E-BOX I normally fly Emirates and will be sticking to them. All in all very bad experience.,11/3/2014,3,3,2,3,2,4
A Nushanya,0,A frequent flyer with GTK Rossiya since I have to travel a lot within CIS and Europe. Recently I have decided to give up the choice in favour for this airline for good. First and major issue is there online booking service. Even if you have booked a flight online and you cc was charged it does not mean you are done. Often flights are being cancelled. Customer service do not even bother to inform the passengers about the changes in advance they just rebook you for another flight on another date (that happens!) and then refuse to make a full refund if you decide to completely cancel your itinerary due to the fact they have cancelled the flight on exact date you needed. To reach their head office in St Petersburg by phone is a nearly impossible mission since it is permanently busy. Reaching customer support toll free number is useless since they will anyway send you out for a personal visit to their office. As you can imagine it is very handful for business travellers. Visit to the office is a guaranteed 2 hours waiting in a queue. A typical Russian service for a not so cheap price after all. They do not have to care about customers satisfaction since they will anyway hold up to 60% of the market. There are basically only two sufficient airlines in Russia - Rossiya and Aeroflot. Both state owned and both with beyond bad approach to customers. Unfortunately no other choice. Its a shame that a huge country like Russia with distances of up to 10000 km from Central to Far East destinations can not offer its citizens an airline we could be proud of. Do not fly with Rossiya Airlines unless you have no other choice of course.,12/31/2008,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,2
A Klugerman,1,"We flew Ottawa-Toronto-San Francisco and returned Los Angeles-Toronto-Ottawa, business class on all trips. The flights to and from Toronto to Ottawa were uneventful. The food served was a fruit plate. The flight to San Francisco was OK except for the fact that by the time that the FA got to be he said that he was all out of meat, fish, and chicken and the only thing he had left was pasta. I am on a low carb diet so I ate very little. In fact, he told me that I should eat salad. On the flight from Los Angeles, there were sufficient meals so that I had my choice. The FA here was very pleasant and accommodating. In general, Air Canada business class for North America is nothing special with seats that do not provide a lot more room than economy and the food is only the middle of the road. I question the economic worthiness of the North American business class.",6/16/2015,2,3,3,4,3,6
A Obispo,0,I travelled with my 12-month old baby London-Jeddah-Manila. My experience was the worst travel ever! London to Jeddah was acceptable. Jeddah airport is not so worthy to be called an airport to its facilities and unfriendly airport staff - there was no baby changing area nor a feeding area. Flight stewardess from Jeddah to Manila was not so helpful at all! My baby was crying for a long time and none of them bothered to ask if I needed help.I will never travel with Saudi Arabian Airlines again and will never recommend it to anyone.,11/10/2013,4,2,3,2,1,3
A Kostanti,0,I flew from Montreal to Athens. Although the flight arrived on time the 9 hours in the plane were a nightmare. Seats extremely small staff inexperienced and rude food horrible entertainment non-existent cabin dirty and smelly and they charge extra for things such as a simple glass of wine. I will never fly with Rouge again.,5/20/2015,1,1,1,1,1,2
A O'Brien,1,Amsterdam to Rio June 2013. First time traveling KLM and it was a very good experience. A hot meal served a couple of hours into the flight then mid-flight a hot snack was served. An hour prior to landing crew came around again with a choice of Ice Cream or Crisps. The presentation of the food looked a little bit cheap but the quality was good. Cabin crew were excellent. Every hour at least there were crew members in the cabin with a drinks tray offering water/juice etc. Inflight entertainment was good and the seat was comfortable. I would have no hesitation in using KLM again.,7/4/2013,5,4,5,5,5,10
A Kreyssig,1,Dec 21 2013 LH431 ORD-FRA. Efficient and friendly service. The new 747-8 aircraft offers a modern ambience in the Economy class LH standard seats with individual now well-functioned entertainment system but still the usual limited space.,1/17/2014,4,3,4,4,5,8
A Odahara,0,Flew Hong Kong to Shanghai Pudong return over Christmas and generally had a pleasant flying experience. No delays in either direction and cabin crew were friendlier and politer than other Chinese airlines' cabin crews tend to be. Only complaint would be the seats are incredibly cramped and there is very little leg room. I'm a quite average 175cm tall and had to sit at a slight angle the whole flight. Because of this I probably wouldn't consider flying Spring Airlines for flights longer than 2 hours which is a shame because otherwise I had no complaints. No inflight entertainment.,12/31/2013,3,1,0,1,4,6
A Krummacher,1,SIN-DAD on Airbus A320. Plane departed and arrived on time. Service onboard excellent directly after take off drinks were served and crew made several rounds during the flight. Food a big disappointment - a tasteless chicken curry and no salt and pepper in the cutlery bag. In terms of seating just like any other standard airline. Price was low and got me to my destination safely so will use them again.,12/29/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,6
A Oharkova,0,Panama to Frankfurt Economy. The stewards were not really customer oriented no smile just robotic. The entertainment onboard was a couple of TV screens playing some Disney films and 2 normal movies. You can buy headphones for 3.5 EUR however many passengers did not have Euros. The quality of meal was ok but the problem appeared with the first snack - the steward simply forgot to give the snack to me and my partner. Later I asked for it and they did not even say sorry - she just told me It happened because her colleague was too fast. I know I travelled in Economy Class but still I paid enough to deserve suitable behaviour from staff.,9/27/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,3
A Krummacher,1,I use Indigo regularly to fly BKK-DEL. Great airline with great fares! Easy to navigate website with no hidden costs. Never had any delays actual departure in many cases before the scheduled departure time. Extremely friendly and cheerful crew. Only complaint the rather expensive food and drink onboard and not accepting Indian currency on international flights.,5/30/2013,5,3,3,1,5,9
A Oliveira,0,Guangzhou-Amsterdam Schipol. When it came time for aperitifs to be served I asked for a tonic gin as usual which was refused as they do not offer this. Nothing was served with the drink. I asked then for red wine as aperitif. It was served half a cup of wine. About 50 minutes later the meal was miserably served. About 30 minutes after the food the dinner drinks came. Breakfast before arrival at Amsterdam composed of again chicken noodles. Later some kind of bread but nothing to put in it not even a small packet of cheap butter. During the night service nothing but water no coffee available. It has been the worst flight I had with a disgusting service.,10/6/2013,1,3,1,3,1,1
A Kudrewicz,0,Moscow to Sanya and back. Flight to Sanya (with one change and stop) was ok though food and inflight service is quite poor. Return to Moscow was horrible. Flight from Sanya to Guangzhou was delayed 2 hrs so we missed our plane to Moscow from Guangzhou. Ground service of the airline was very bad. They were slow and spoke poor English. We spent almost 3 hrs after arrival to re-book our tickets collect luggage and wait for the hotel transfer. Flight CZ6001 was very difficult. After check-in the whole flight was taken for a security check 20 min before boarding: you go for the check wait get a card in addition to a boarding pass wait in another zone then go downstairs to a bus collect the card then almost 30 minutes on a bus to the plane. Stop in Urumqi for passport control you leave the plane wait in line for passport control go to wait for the boarding back then take off. They feed you just twice - once between CAN-URC and then once between URC-MOW.,1/29/2014,3,2,1,1,1,1
A Orlowski,1,GDN-WAW-MXP return E170/175. Clean airplanes sandwich and drinks on way to MXP juice and refeshment on domestic flight. Staff friendly. Due to fog in GDN we couldn't land and had to fly back to Warsaw LOT organised a hotel food and transport and rebooked us for the nearest flight.,11/17/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Kumar,1,SCL-SYD and SYD-HKG in business. Flight from Santiago to Sydney did not get off to a flying start due to a ridiculous check in system that took 20 minutes at the counter and another 10 minutes waiting in a line for a point to point journey. Unacceptable for business class. Flight was on-time and the Boeing 747 was complete with comfortable fully flat beds which while in a conventional forward layout were incredibly spacious and converted into a full length bed. IFE was AVOD had a good number of options which while not as extensive as some ultra tech savvy carriers like Emirates was wonderfully edited with excellent selections. The food was wonderful with a clear emphasis on fresh food that included a number of options prepared onboard. I loved the flexibility of choosing from an extensive menu at any time instead of the conventional set options at set times. The crew service was mostly exceptionally warm and attentive save for one crew member who seemed totally out of place. SYD-HKG was on an A380 and once again the check in time was far too long although the agent herself was efficient and friendly. Boarding staff greeted me in Hindi. A380 had the same seats and was immaculate. The small lounge area was a nice touch. The catering on this leg was excellent beating the high standards of the previous legs and I can safely say that it was one of the best inflight meals I have had. Crew were friendly attentive relaxed and very efficient. I was overall pleasantly surprised. There are some issues however particularly check in and certain crew and ground members that are marring the work of other staff who are going above and beyond and an airline that is trying to compete with the best in the business and seems to be pretty much up there particularly in terms of product quality. Overall better then BA Swiss Emirates and Qatar. I rate them at par with CX and perhaps just shy of sq. Hopefully their ongoing financial crisis will not let standards slip.,1/14/2014,4,5,5,5,4,8
A Orzechowski,1,Venice - Tunis and Monastir - Nice. Tunisair impressed me again! They serve hot tasty meal on flights that are in the air for only 1 hour 10 minutes. Crew is only bilingual (Arabic and French) which is fun.,8/20/2014,4,4,4,3,4,9
A PÃ¤rsson,1,ARN-WAW-JFK. First time connecting through WAW and first time flying LOT I did not quite know what to expect. Arrived in WAW on time had no trouble at all finding the gate. WAW overall seemed fresh and nice with free WiFi and a lot of power outlets even loading stations if you forgot your iphone charger. The boarding process was pretty smooth and we pushed back with a 15 min delay. As for the flight this was my first time on a 787 and I loved it. The plane is very quiet and looks great big nice windows with a dimming-function I've never encountered before. The IFE was alright a very good selection of Hollywood movies however if you are a movie geek like me you've might have seen some of the finest picks. The seat comfort was OK. Good amount of leg space seat was fairly comfortable and the tables where very functional. The food was fine nothing special really but I wasn't flying hungry or thirsty. Overall the service on the plane was really good the flight attendants always had a smile on their face and were quick to assist you if you needed anything. We arrived at JFK 20min before scheduled time. Bottom line I would not hesitate to fly with LOT again especially when their prices are generally lower then Lufthansa or KLM.,5/31/2015,5,4,4,4,5,9
A Kupferman,0,"March 9 2013. DMK-KUL AK1941. March 12 2013 KUL-DMK FD2916. You cannot expect much from a low cost airline but Air Asia certainly hits the bottom when they not only charge a 12 USD supplement for their ""Red Seats"" where you have more knee space (although the difference is nominal) but they also charge a supplement for the other seats as if you could fly standing. But what revolted me most is that you have to pay extra charges for the use of a wheelchair (3 USD per use amounting to 12 USD for a round trip) to make money from handicapped people is a novelty.",8/19/2013,3,2,1,1,2,5
A Pagan,1,ATH-DXB-ATH. Arriving at check-in flight was overbooked in economy. They offered me an upgrade to business at 300 euros per sector. During booking business class price was 1300 euros so I stayed with J. An A345 the seat was comfortable and pitch just ok. Catering ok but really nothing special. Crew very attentive IFE the typical ICE on EK which is not my taste. Variety of movies limited. Flight arrived on time. Return a different story. Again overbooked flight and the same offer. Still on J class on a 777-300. Boarding and a bus ride that literally took 37 minutes. Nice tour of the airport! Flight departed with 30 minutes delay due to the bus ride as we got into the plane 5 minutes before the STD. Same thing on catering and seat. This time crew was a bit uninterested and robotic. Arriving in ATH and we have to wait for our bags more than 25 minutes. All in all an average experience. Next time and my schedule permits I will try Etihad or Qatar as their ticket price is a bit lower and inflight service seems to be better than EK.,5/7/2014,3,4,4,4,3,7
A Kuschel,0,"SVO-PVG-SVO. Quite new Airbus 330-300 with sufficient inflight entertainment (if its working). Seats very poor actually with much less space than on the A320 I flew to Moscow with. Cabin crew generally never smile and disappear after lunch. Though my personal entertainment system was not working and my seat was broken no one apologized all I got from the stewardess was an unfriendly ""yes its broke"" then she went away. If you're on a budget Aeroflot long haul might be an option but be aware that you'll suffer big time for the 200â‚¬ you save. The difference to Aeroflot short haul European flights could not be more striking.",5/8/2012,3,1,3,3,2,3
A Palframan,0,Flight was from Toronto to Dublin. Seats were small and cramped. Drinks took forever to be served and were chargeable (on a transatlantic flight). Crew were very pleasant but there weren't enough of them and service was slow and poor. Food quality was poor - army standards. I am sure there are better airlines doing a better job - WestJet or Air Canada.,9/28/2014,2,1,1,4,1,5
A Panah,0,LHR-IKA. Online check-in easy in London (not available in Tehran). Small seat-pitch on A321 and inflight entertainment only provided on overhead screens on a 6-hour flight. Food was tasty but small both ways. Return flight a disaster as due to the load and amount of baggage the plane was forced to land in Amsterdam to be refuelled delaying us by 2 hours. Overall a poor experience not worth the huge price paid.,8/29/2010,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,4
A Kusnierczak,1,It was nice journey onboard Thai Lion Air (SL8201) on route Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok Don Mueang. New Boeing 737-900 had not enough legroom but it was quite nice. The problem was that our flight was delayed about 15 h and there was no any announcement about it. Another problem is that during booking I couldn't choose my seat or check-in online. Price was very affordable. I will recommend and choose Thai Lion Air again.,3/18/2014,5,4,3,3,3,7
A Kuznetsov,1,I flew DME-DEL-GOI-DEL-DME in mid December. What can I say - before making the first flight with AI I thought it wouldn't be the best experience. Now the reality: staff are polite and efficient both on international and domestic segments. A bit unorganized on the ground. Food - good. It's Indian expect curry but a very good curry and quite a large portion. aircraft's: all-new 787 and 319. They are just new and I have nothing to complain. Entertainment system is not to Emirates standards but quite close to that on Lufthansa's new 747-8. So the price is not cheap but the airline provides a good product for that price. Will fly them again.,12/29/2014,4,5,5,3,5,9
A Paraskeva,1,Flew twice with Monarch. Outbound and Inbound. My flights were ZB994 and ZB995 20/06/14-27/06/14 Birmingham to Hurghada and back. First time flying Monarch Hurghada new destination for them. Thought give it a try as they were offering really good prices compared to other airlines. Â£178 each way per person which is really good for Egypt! Flights on time cabin crew were really polite and helpful on both flights. Check in staff are really good. We arrived early for check in and they checked us in early as well as checking in the hand luggage too. Had the old cabin on both flights G-OZBE on ZB994 and G-OZBG on ZB995. Cabin's are really cramped for a 6 hour flight but for the price we paid couldn't really expect first class no entertainment provided either which was surprising for a long flight was prepared anyway bringing my own. Would recommend would travel again.,7/1/2014,5,3,4,1,5,6
A Kyprianou,0,Luton to Larnaca. OK as expected. Larnaca to Luton - different aircraft - non reclining seats on 5 hour night flight. Completely crazy? Non-reclining seats may be acceptable for a 1-2 hour flight but a plane load of passengers dying for some sleep many of whom have a long drive when they arrive back in the UK is nuts. Couldn't see that they had got anymore seats onto the plane because of it. If you want to save weight stick to the 10kg cabin bag limit and not let people into the cabin with full size 20kg suitcases.,12/6/2013,2,1,0,0,3,NaN
A Paris,0,I'm currently sitting at the gate for my United flight at LAX. A gentleman came out of the gate off of a flight obviously in a hurry and quickly asked where the connecting flight for Newark was. The staff here looked at him like it was the most inconvenient question in the world. They closed the doors for the tarmac before all passengers were inside which left them outside knocking on the door. Not one member of the staff let them in so an airline customer opened the door which set off an alarm. Again the staff did nothing and let the alarm go off for minutes. Definitely not impressed not to mention every time the gal came over the loud speaker she sounded like se had no clue what was going on. She kept getting flights confused and putting out wrong information. I will make sure I don't fly with them again.,2/25/2014,2,3,1,1,1,2
A Lafaye,0,I was booked on flight AR1893 USH-FTE 2nd Jan 2014 departing at 13.35. Arrived at the airport at 12.00 facing a long queue due to problems with check in system. Around 45 min prior the flight departure while still queuing for check in they announced our flight cancelled. They made us wait until 19.00 to tell us that we had to come back tomorrow for more info. We were given no food not hotel organised. Staff at the airport were arrogant refusing to speak English to non Spanish speaking customers and uninformative. Never again!,1/3/2014,2,0,3,0,1,NaN
A Pascale,0,"Flew back from Milan LIN on Jan 4th. Because of ""mist"" (the pilot's actual characterization) most flights that morning had been delayed/canceled in/out of LHR. No delay info given at check-in nor at gate. Upon boarding the captain informed us that because of ""mist"" we were being held on the ground for 2 hours. My connecting flight to SFO was 2.5 hrs after landing in LHR. Flight attendant assured me most flights were being delayed therefore mine to SFO most likely too. Upon landing in LHR a sea of canceled/delayed lost souls. I was immediately told I was forced to miss my connection because my flight to SFO was on time. I was forced to join the longest line I've ever seen for rebooking. It never moved. We were told another set of rebooking desks were available upstairs ""and faster"". Crossing the border control took just as long. Upstairs it took me 5 hours just to get closer to the desks but still at least a couple hours away. I finally managed to join the free wifi and call BA's office to get rebooked online. I was rebooked on a flight from SFO to LHR. The wrong way around. When I pointed out the obvious the agent told me there was a ""computer glitch"" and promised to call me back. She finally called me back and got rebooked on AA flights to JFK and to SFO from there. The next morning at the AA check in they could not check me in on the JFK-SFO because of ""issues with the BA ticket"". It took 90 minutes and multiple interactions with 3 different desks to get it solved. I nearly missed the flight to JFK too. My suitcase was never loaded on that flight and I didn't get it at JFK. It took me 5 days to get my suitcase back. I will never fly British Airways again.",1/28/2015,1,3,1,3,3,1
A Lamb,0,We travelled last week to Las Vegas. We were an hour stuck on the plane whilst they sorted an issue with the cargo hold! This made our plane arrive into LV over an hour late. The outward trip was the most horrible experience small cramped seats rubbish not taken away enough times so you had to sit with tray open until they decided to remove it. The inflight entertainment was great if you were make and wanted to watch action and gory films! As I am not a male the only other choice was a chick flick and some awful comedy. On the return we boarded the plane 30 mins late and were told this was due to the crew arriving late! Mind you they had a 2 day stay to get over the flight there! We were again in cramped small seats the service a bit better but no change in movies! We would never fly by Virgin again and would not recommend them to anyone. Last time we went by BA and they were far superior.,10/20/2013,1,1,3,1,3,3
A Patel,0,Flying to the Maldives via Mumbai from Ahmedabad on Sept 14th. Checked in and were told flight was on time. We were to have a 5 hour break in Mumbai giving us plenty of time to catch connection on Sri Lanka Airways. The flight never arrived and was 4 hours late taking off although AI personnel insisting we would make our connection. Never did no help from AI personnel in Mumbai and worst experience on a flight ended up in transit at the airport for over 26 hours.,10/1/2014,1,3,2,0,1,1
A Lane,1,Newcastle to Bergen return: We were flying on the smaller of their two aircraft and there were a total of four passengers plus one flight attendant. All four passengers were seated in the very rear of the plane most likely to balance the weight due to the small aircraft. The good thing about flying with Eastern was that probably it was included in the cost of the tickets but passengers are allowed to go through the Fast Track security line. Also at Newcastle International terminal gate 31 is exclusive for Eastern. The terminal lounge was tiny and had bowls of sweets and copies of their inflight magazine. The downside is that the aircraft is very noisy so one has a problem hearing the inflight announcements and the aircraft seems to feel turbulence being so tiny. Also if you need to use the toilet try not to otherwise it's located in the rear of the plane behind a door that you need to be sure is securely locked or you risk giving a show. I could not for anything find a sink but there was a bottle of hand sanitizer that was available. The flight from Bergen there was no dedicated terminal lounge. The so-called complimentary refreshments on both flights were only drinks and either a packet of sweet or savoury snacks. The flight from Bergen the flight attendant offered hot towels just prior to landing. This wasn't offered on the flight from Newcastle. The flights were over an hour each and I think they could and should have served sandwiches considering they advertise how they are a cut above the other airlines. Perhaps it's due to mounting costs but other than those tiny packets of snacks they bombarded us with sweets before and during the flights. The sweets are not the best quality too. Return flight had a total of twelve passengers and one flight attendant. As stated in earlier reviews it seems as though Eastern doesn't have a huge customer base so I'm not sure how they manage to exist.,6/17/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Paul,0,"The Manila - Dubai flight was unceremoniously switched to Manila - Abu Dhabi at the point of passenger Check-in on December 19th 2013. You have to swallow their attitude of: ""We're sorry our flight to Dubai is not operational today we will be re-routing you to Abu Dhabi"" and get you to Dubai in a Shuttle Bus. Drop off point not known. Sorry"".",12/20/2013,1,0,1,1,1,NaN
A Pawson,0,Flew from Toliara to Tana. What to say about Air Madagascar - the airline usually runs on Malagasy time and this was no exception. Flight was due to leave at 18.25. By 19.00 no plane had turned up and there was absolutely nobody in the terminal with any kind of information. There are screens in the terminal but as there is only 1 flight per day they are of little use. Fortunately TLE has a fairly modern terminal (for Madagascar) and a number of places to buy drinks. 8pm came and went then 9pm still no plane and it's getting dark. Eventually at about half past 9 three guys arrived in a jeep proceeded to drive down the runway setting up a series of cones with lights on top. The first we knew anything was happening was when a plane appeared on the runway taxied up to the terminal and unloaded some passengers. We were then allowed out onto the tarmac and up the steps to the plane. Plane was a fairly modern 737 seats were reasonably comfortable staff were very friendly and as the plane was only half full the flight was one of the most pleasant I have had on AirMad. Flying with AirMad is always an experience.,8/26/2014,3,3,1,1,2,3
A Pedersen,0,Booked a trip to Vegas and thought we were flying with Air Canada until we got our itinerary that said Air Rouge. The airplane itself was run down and dirty. The seats were uncomfortable but thankfully we paid for the exit rows so we had more leg room. The overhead bins are small and you likely won't get 2 roller cases in the bins. We sat in Row 27 A and C on flight 1851 to Vegas and my boyfriend froze the left side of his body on the flight down. The crew seem very disorganized and no one seems to really know what is going on. There would be an announcement in French only and as an Anglophone I have no idea what they were saying so here's hoping it wasn't overly important. During the flight we had some turbulence and the seat belt sign was on but people continued to use the washrooms and the crew allowed them to do so. Don't think they actually have inflight entertainment as this isn't the case. We downloaded the app onto our Ipad and truthfully it was a waste of time. Their idea of inflight entertainment is to allow you to watch 10 mins of a show and then it crashes forcing you to have to log back on and try and find where you were in the show. This happened to us several times and finally we gave up because a 44 min show would have taken us well over an hour to watch and it was frustrating to have to keep logging back in. One gentleman on our flight even returned his $10 Ipad he borrowed as it's a waste of money when the entertainment doesn't work. We have decided that if we can't fly with Air Canada not Rouge then we will book with another airline regardless of price because this was horrible.,6/4/2014,2,1,2,1,1,3
A Pedersen,1,Hanoi-Warzaw-Copenhagen on B767 and Avroliner 170. Service in Hanoi check-in and lounge excellent. Checked through fast connection to CPH. Onboard service fine (long haul) - 18 seats in Business old design. Food and wines good main meal courses were very average. Tea and coffee not served hot but rectified upon request. New lounge in WAW are excellent. Had to leave airport to re-access Schengen terminal as the transfer check-point for direct transit was not open (did not open until 1 hour upon arrival many people were waiting as they did not want to leave transit). FAs English spoken very limited.,3/1/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,7
A Perovic,1,JFK-LHR-JFK on BA return on code share AA flight on a new 777-300 so opportunity to compare the two airlines. The seats on AA far more comfortable than on BA greater privacy with 1-2-1 configuration free access without having to step over the neighboring passenger plus all seats facing forward something I never liked on BA set up with window seats facing backward. Inflight entertainment beats BA in every respect screens double the size appeared to be HD greater choice of movies. Food was delicious well presented good choice of wines. Ice cream sundae elevated the meal to a guilty decadence. Overall great experience and highly recommended.,6/5/2014,5,5,5,5,4,9
A Peter,1,I flew from Vienna to Cluj and onward to Bucharest. On the first leg they offered me a large and delicious warm meal. On the second part of the trip they offered me two ham and cheese sandwiches with butter a large milka chocolate caramel bar and two drinks including Romanian beer and wine! Seats were comfortable on both occasions the aircraft arrived on time. Excellent legroom and very friendly crew! Will definitely fly TAROM again.,8/5/2013,4,5,5,3,5,10
A Petersen,0,CPH-TLL-CPH. Cabin Crew both ways showed no emotion or enthusiasm. A very clever metal rod has been inserted in each seat which makes it extremely uncomfortable to sit in. No complimentary products on these flights coffee purchased tasted poor creamer had no effect. On the plus side checked baggage was delivered fast on both flights. In the future will look for other alternatives.,10/4/2012,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,3
A Petersen,0,BHX-DXB-KUL. Probably the worst long haul flights I have had. Emirates seems to have deteriorated considerably since my last trip in 2010. Outbound flight was spoilt by passengers who wandering about the cabin visiting friends/relatives at all hours of the night and were not controlled by the cabin crew even when seat belt signs were lit. Although things were better on the return legs staff seemed generally disinterested and demoralised. Food service was very slow (over an hour to serve breakfast). Drinks were served after the meal rather than before. Altogether a very disappointing experience.,4/23/2014,4,2,3,4,1,1
A Philippus,1,Just returned from a trip to Amsterdam via Iceland. No complaints about the on-board service. Pillows and blankets waiting on every seat on the long leg (from Denver to Iceland). Bottled water to pick up on entry into plane and usual drinks served during flight. Luckily I read a review that mentioned you have to purchase food in economy seating so I brought my own. They should mention that more prominently when you book your flight. Also did not know about option to stay over in Iceland for a few days supposedly at no extra ticket cost but I didn't see this offer when I was booking. My only complaint was how little leg room there is on the Boeing 757-200 which is the long leg of the flight. The shorter leg (Iceland to Amsterdam) had the normal amount of leg room; it was a Boeing 757-300. You could always ask for more beverages as much as you like. It is easier to get their attention if you go to the pantry as they are not always walking up and down the aisles.,6/19/2013,4,3,3,3,4,7
A Phillips,0,Awful start to our long awaited holiday. 3 hour delay at Gatwick with very little apology and no complimentary drinks or anything onboard by way of an apology. 3 hour delay again on our return flight from Antalya. Leg room is atrocious on Thomas Cook planes. Will never fly Thomas Cook again.,6/13/2013,1,1,1,1,1,NaN
A Pinapala,0,Southwest airlines was able to give me the worst experience I ever had flying in an airplane which is very difficult considering I am on a flight 3-4 days a week. This was on Flight 110 from FLL to BNA on May 20 the flight was initially delayed for a short period of time due to ground delay and then a ground stop. However 60 minutes into waiting on the runway the flight had to return to the gate because they were out of required fuel. I have spent my share of long waits on runway but never had a flight turnback for fuel for a delay of 60-90 mins. This speaks about Southwest's abject lack of focus on customer service and complete focus on economics. The flight pushed back from gate after 1.20pm even though the gate was closed 5-10 mins before it and its now 3.03pm we are parked at the gate waiting for fuel refill. There hasn't been a single word or indication of when the expected time of departure or ETA is and the flight staff seem to be only smiling at our misery.,5/20/2013,1,3,0,NaN,2,NaN
A Lanz,1,LGW-KEF-LGW over the August bank holiday weekend. I was rather sceptical when booking as I have never heard of the airline but was positively surprised by the experience considering the are marketing themselves as a LCC. I had to rebook my flight back and they obviously charged a (reasonable) rebooking fee plus fare difference but it was a easy simple process. Check-In at LGW was smooth and without any issues. My friend checked in about half an hour earlier but they kept a seat free next to him until I checked in which was great. Obviously being a LCC there's only buy on board stuff but crew was incredibly friendly funny and efficient. Oh and there's inflight entertainment showing a movie on the overhead screens. The A320 was leased from Air Bulgaria and still had their saftey card in the seat pocket but it was clean and quite comfortable with decent pitch and seat recline (contrary to other LCCs where it's more of a chicken farm experience). On the way back because there were 3 flights leaving roughly at the same time the queue was quite long but again check-in staff was efficient and friendly. Flight uneventful crew friendly and both flights on time arriving slightly early. I would definitively fly them again.,9/10/2013,5,4,3,3,5,9
A Pivovar,0,Flights from St Petersburg to Moscow are now from the Pulkovo New Terminal. Comfort Lounge (business lounge not available) is awful. It's worse than regular space. No food no beverages (only water and coca cola). Dirty chairs only instant coffee.,12/21/2013,1,3,1,1,1,6
A Plug,1,Travelled from Launceston to Perth via Melbourne May 6 2014. As usual email and text reminders re departure were spot-on. Check-in and boarding at LST were smooth and efficient announcements clear and accurate. Departure was exactly on time flight uneventful until flight got stuck in a holding pattern for 40+ minutes before landing at Melbourne due to runway incident. Departure from Melbourne was also delayed relevant announcements were clear accurate and informative. Flight to Perth in older B737 no seatback screens and the seatback/headrest adjustment was not working properly (essential for taller passengers) which made for uncomfortable flight (not my usual experience BTW). Bags were waiting by the time we reached the baggage claim area - incredibly quick even by Virgin's standards. All staff were very professional - efficient friendly and extremely helpful. All round not quite up to Virgin Australia's usual high standards but by no means unsatisfactory.,5/7/2014,4,2,3,2,5,7
A Lawrence,1,PER-KUL-PER. Check-in fast. Friendly and pleasant flight staff. Would have like to have seen more of them however. Somewhat hard to track down. Puzzled by breakfast out of Perth which was roast beef veggies and potatoes. Was short a couple bucks for blanket back to PER but attendant let it slide. For the extra few dollars Hot Seats are the way to go as AA flights are usually pretty full.,5/14/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Learmont,0,Cape Town to Johannesburg Lanseria on 03 Jan 2013. Flight was supposed to leave at 15.50. Received an SMS that the flight had been delayed to 18.00 then further delayed to 20.00. When I arrived at the airport to check in told that the flight was delayed until 00.45. No information coming out of the Kulula desk other than mixed reports. The only compensation we received was a meal voucher. Flight further delayed until 01.30 in the morning. The Kulula desk took our details and assured us there would be a taxi at the other end. When we arrived at Lanseria airport - no taxis in sight. When the 'shuttle' arrived it was a lone taxi driver. At no point did we receive any apology or plausible explanation. On top of that the 'quirky' in-flight announcements were not funny (not at 01.30 in the morning). I will never recommend this airline again.,1/11/2013,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Pontes,1,SA 234 JNB to Heathrow. A good flight experience food was enjoyable. Captain's announcement was friendly sincere and fun. Had a good crew.,5/7/2014,5,5,5,4,4,9
A Pontes,0,I flew with TAP 3 times two internal flights LIS-FUN-LIS and regional flight LIS-MUN. I'm on their loyalty program so try to be very supportive of them. Once in the air I think TAP is fine and I do enjoy their food in Business Class. But getting going is the issue on all 3 flights there was a delay. First 3 hours after changing aircraft 3 times then a 1.5 hr delay and finally an improvement but still 20 minutes late. The fact that I spent 5 hours extra in airports with the same airline makes me question whether they are reliable at all with their time.,7/22/2012,3,3,4,3,3,5
A Lee,0,"While I did get my value for money, I wouldn't consider flying Emirates again. Ground service at Sydney airport was ok. Check-in was quick and smooth. However, at the gate staff were generally unfriendly and quick to dismiss people. The person managing the gate seemed tired and angry at customers. The plane was clean and quite spacious. The seats were comfortable and the inflight entertainment was very good. There was a very large selection of entertainment. However, the flight was significantly let down by the crew. When boarding, the flight attendant at the door sent me down the wrong aisle. When serving the hot towels, the flight attendant literally threw a towel at me. During the meal service, the flight attendant gave me the wrong order. Instead, she gave me my seatmate's order (and gave my seatmate my order). Additionally during the drinks service, the flight attendant seem bothered when I asked what tea they were offering. Ultimately I thought the crew were inexperienced, tired and annoyed. This was my first flight with Emirates, and it unfortunately has given me a bad impressions of the airline.",7/2/2015,5,4,3,5,2,5
A Porter,0,Newcastle to Dalaman return journey. On time both ways very good. Terribly uncomfortable seats metal poking through and loose wires hanging out of armrests. But what made us decide to never fly with this airline again is the rudeness of the staff on both journeys. Everything was just too much trouble where did these staff receive their training to attain such attitude!,10/13/2009,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,4
A Leger,1,Early-morning Geneva-Brussels flight on A319. Comfortable slim line leather seats. Efficient and professional cabin crew. One complaint only: hot beverages unavailable due to water tank left empty because of extreme freezing temperatures in Geneva.,2/27/2012,5,5,0,0,5,9
A Praszek,1,I flew with Qantas at the end of Sept 2014 from LHR to DXB in economy. Seat was ok with some extra space for legs which is essential for me as I'm tall. Flight attendants were polite and smiling. Pre-ordered special meal was of good quality. Toilets were clean and pretty well maintained. Inflight entertainment was great especially the music collection. I don't mind flying with Qantas again in the future.,10/8/2014,4,4,4,5,4,8
A Price,1,Toronto to London Heathrow - 26/10/14. After reading how the 747's are really starting to show their age I opted to fly this return route on board the new 787 that BA has to offer. The outbound flight in economy a week earlier had been great food and entertainment was good staff very pleasant but it was a bit of a tight squeeze in the seats I think a 2-3-2 configuration would work a bit better. I arrived at Pearson Airport Terminal 3 booked to return to London in World Traveller Plus. Visited the Premium Plaza Lounge nice and comfy but nothing special. Boarding was really rather chaotic but I was delighted to be upgraded to Business Class at the gate! Seat 3F was a good aisle seat very comfortable spacious plenty of storage space and close to the toilets which I find more useful than bothersome there was never any queue to use them that could've disturbed me. Cabin crew were superb and attentive always addressing by name and happy to help with any queries and requests. The drinks service and the quality of the food was excellent beef tenderloin followed by lemon tart and well presented. Whilst I generally struggle to sleep on flights I found the flat bed very comfortable indeed especially with the mood lighting on this night flight. Breakfast a fruit salad and selection of pastries was again very pleasant to start the morning. On time departure and arrival from Gate C66 at T5 through border control and luggage collected took just 25 minutes. Overall highly impressive from British Airways would absolutely use Club World again.,10/31/2014,4,4,5,5,5,9
A Leigh-Ewers,0,Flew Adelaide to London and back again in Aug/Sep 2013 business class. The A330 from Adelaide to KL has to be the most uncomfortable seating experience I have ever had and as far as converting into a bed and getting any sleep that is quite impossible. The A380 KL to London is comfortable but Malaysia Airlines has chosen the most basic of fit outs and this shows (I flew Emirates recently on the A380 in business class so can make a direct comparison). As always staff polite and helpful and food good but the planes let the airline down badly. Will not be using them again.,9/26/2013,1,1,5,3,5,4
A Proschel,1,LHR to SFO March 2014 Upper Class Lounge at Heathrow excellent with huge choice of freshly made food and drinks including champagne. The Cowshed has large range of treatments if you so wish showers etc and very polite and helpful lounge staff. Upper Class really lived up to its name on outbound trip nothing too much trouble. Meals including quality wines afternoon tea with delicate pastries and macaroons. Seat / flatbed really comfortable plenty of varied inflight entertainment. Return trip still very good with exception of one cabin staff member she was not enjoying her job at all and really didn't want to be there as I overheard her telling a man in seat behind me! She gave me wrong breakfast and when I remarked on this she said it was what I ordered only when another passenger had same problem did she realise she had mixed order up trays were swapped but no apology. This was only problem and her poor attitude didn't take anything away from the flight enjoyment fabulous to lie flat and be able to sleep. We had flown from San Fran to Hawaii with Hawaiian Airlines and didn't realise until we returned we could claim partner airmiles but needed boarding cards which we hadn't kept customer services were brilliant and gave us the airmiles as a kindness great PR and we will be booking with Virgin again very soon If Flight crew are good it's a great trip but poor /rude crew can really ruin your flight this should be addressed as Virgin has a great product.,8/28/2014,4,4,5,5,3,9
A Levy,0,If you're traveling with children don't pick this airline. We flew 5.5 hours to New York and not one not two but all three of the TVs provided for our kids didn't work. You can imagine our flight experience. What was Jet Blue willing to do for this? A $15 credit only if we fly on Jet Blue again and only if we pay for another flight with them within the next year! So for our inconvenience we get to book and pay for another flight with them! Oh and they refused to allow the credit to be used on the flight for the trip home!,12/17/2013,3,3,2,1,2,3
A Puhakka,1,"Overall pretty good experience on flights HEL-YYZ-HEL. Outbound flight left slightly late but arrived 15 min early but return flight left an hour late due to overbooking and missing passengers as we were told. Due to overbooking of economy class, business class was full on return flight. It seems to me that upgrades were not given to Finnair plus tier or oneworld tier members but on a random basis. There should be a system that honors frequens fliers over the others. I know this is one thing that irritates most for higher Finnair plus tier members, and Finnair is losing these customers. Seats are full-flat but slightly narrow for sleeping. Nice pillow and good duvet and both were clean on both flights. Service was good, as it should be in business class. On return flight service was even better due to purser's efforts to deliver more personal service. Extra credit for that. Food was better for outbound flight. The main course was pretty good for airline meals. The dessert selection is Finnair's weak point for sure. There's an ice cream which are tiny prepacked cups of HÃ¤agen-Dazs or Macarons for example. Entertainment system has been upgraded and selection is better but still lacking behind of many airlines. Why can't there be a separate bus for business class passangers when there's a bus gate arrival in HEL?",6/25/2015,4,4,3,3,4,8
A Lewy,0,"We flew to Dominican Republic on 14 February in Thomson's new Sardineliner. The seat width is 1 inch less than usual to cram more people in Economy and although there is more leg room being unable to move left us both with an aching back. The food was horrible. Frozen food was stored in the Passenger overhead lockers leaving insufficient room for passengers belongings and water condensed on the boxes and dripped on our clothes - my jacket in the locker was soaking wet. The plane had to make an emergency landing and use the full length of the runway because the top wing flaps failed to work. We learned that 2 weeks previous the flight was delayed by 24hrs because of technical problems. Our return flight was delayed 24hrs due to ""technical problems"" again. We were moved to inferior accommodation. The only good thing I can say is that the pilot kept everyone well informed and was honest about all problems encountered.",3/10/2014,2,1,1,1,3,1
A Libien,1,DRW-DPS-DRW. Check-in quick. Staff polite and helpful. Departure slightly delayed due to late arrival of aircraft from southern port. Flight uneventful. Ordered a sandwich and was pleasantly surprised. Check-in at DPS was quick. Counter staff very helpful and polite. Flight left early. Very smooth and quiet. Arrived in DRW early. Baggage available quickly. My major concern is that Jetstar frequently either cancels or delays flights for no apparent reason. Getting to and from anywhere on time seems to be a matter of luck.,7/25/2012,3,3,4,0,4,7
A Quinn,0,We booked four flights this year for CWL to BCN and return. Vueling managed to cancel one with three days notice and alter the other three. One flight they altered left us at BCN at 0130 on a Monday morning. Another they altered from Saturday to Sunday. To make matters worse we tried to rebook to different days and they wanted another 156 Euros. No reply to e-mails so eventually rang them on their Premium Rate phone line which cost Â£10. It cost an extra Â£400 to use this airline for our holidays this year in rebooked flights and additional accommodation and all without the slightest apology. I would have been cheaper to fly Club Class with BA. Use this airline at your peril. They are cavalier about their schedules and don't give a damn about their customers.,10/8/2012,1,1,3,0,2,2
A Lim,0,Flew Auckland to Guangzhou and return in the past week. The in-flight service was terrible on the way back to New Zealand and services were carried out without a single smile from any of the cabin crew. All the cabin crew had minimal English and were abrupt and inclined to give passengers any meal or drink irrespective of what was requested. They made assumptions that just because we spoke English we would therefore have an English meal. A smile would go a long way. Snacks were seen down in the kitchen area of the plane but we did not once have any of this offered. Hygiene standards questionable. When I went down to the back of the plane for a stretch and to ask for a glass of water I was ignored. Another hostess on her return trip back to that area answered my request once I caught her eye but all done without any eye contact or smile or any verbal exchange. Would not fly this airline again. For an international airline one would expect a better level of English language. At the end of the flight only one cabin crew in sight at the aircraft door and she was busy doing things so even if one wished to say thank you there was no one to say it to.,4/19/2014,3,4,2,4,2,3
A Lim,0,Houston TX (IAH) to Hong Kong (HKG) 9/23/13. Arrived in Beijing (PEK) to transfer to Hong Kong on 9/23/13 around 04.30am. Found out our flight to Hong Kong was cancelled due to the Super Typhoon. Tried to reschedule but was met with the worst customer service! Ticket counter employee was not only rude but unhelpful. Stated the only way to get to Hong Kong was to get on a flight on 09/28/13 or get on a flight to Shenzhen the follow day 09/24/13. Told the employee that our temporary visa was only good until 9/24/13. The employee then proceeded to rudely state that once we get to Shenzhen we were on our own to pay for the train into Hong Kong that the airline will not pay for. Told that we had to get out of the terminal and go to the booking counter to get our flight changed. We proceeded to head out but was stopped by another Air China employee that rudely said we cannot leave because we don't have a ticket to fly out. Finally was able to get my new ticket. Got on my flight to Shenzhen at 11.30am 9/24/13. Arrived in Shenzhen and caught a bus to Hong Kong. Stopped by the boarder security that said we were not allowed to leave Shenzhen and that our temporary visa was only good for Beijing! 0 customer service. Will never fly with this airline again.,9/25/2013,1,0,0,0,1,NaN
A Raath,1,On flight CX 749 from Hong Kong to Johannesburg Wednesday 23 April 2014 my friend became ill and went into a semi coma. The staff were brilliant and two staff were excellent for the efficient way in which they dealt with the person. Thank you for all the support! to get your act together because passengers that get up at 4:00am for an early flight expect to arrive on time.,5/25/2014,5,5,5,4,5,10
A Lindley,1,I travel between CPT and WHK and haven't been on a single flight that's departed on time.

A Lipman,0,We traveled from TLV-JNB on EL AL and then on to CPT in December 2012. I have been travelling EL AL all my life and this trip showed how the quality of their product has deteriorated. We flew on an old 762 which only benefit was the good legroom. The food (special kosher) was atrocious there was only a limited (non alcoholic) bar selection and the entertainment was virtually non existent. Fortunately it was a night flight and the reasonably spacious aircraft allowed us to sleep. The staff however were very friendly and helpful and I felt they were trying to make up for the inadequacy of the rest of the product. On the way back SAA caused us to miss the EL AL flight back to TLV from JNB and very kindly sent us via London where we stayed with family for a weekend before returning to TLV on BA in one of their newly refurbished A321 mid-hauls.,4/17/2013,2,4,1,2,5,3
A Raj Gopal,1,MEL-ICN-LGW and CDG-ICN-MEL. 777-300ER and A330s were clean comfortable and well presented. Very diverse inflight entertainment with the biggest screens in economy I have ever seen. The seats recline more than any other airline I have traveled internationally on - not only does the back support tilt but the seat bottom also pitches out to give a much flatter and more comfortable resting position. Incredibly polite and helpful staff. Food was top-notch. Incheon is an excellent airport. Never delayed. Will definitely fly them again.,8/16/2012,5,5,5,5,5,10
A Llewellyn-Evans,1,Sydney to Abu Dhabi and then to Athens and back from Istanbul to Sydney in September and October this year. We were lucky enough to gain upgrades for the two longer legs and this made the flight more enjoyable. As all the previous writer indicate there certainly is a step up with Business class and while I could not justify paying the full price the chance to upgrade sections is worthwhile. The space is the major gain you have what seems the equivalent of 3 seats you can stretch out have places which to store books glasses and water bottles and certainly the amenity kit is worthwhile. The service also improves with a higher staff ratio and they were certainly attentive to all needs from extra blankets to late night snacks (I can recommend the steak sandwich). The food which while not that much better than economy is presented in a more sophisticated way and taken with the space makes dinning an enjoyable experience. Would I recommend the upgrade yes for the longer legs 12-14 hours for the shorter ones 4-6 hours you can survive!,10/22/2013,4,5,5,5,5,9
A Ratilal,1,CPH-TXL-DUS-ZRH. New and clean aircraft. Snacks served crew were friendly even though we only spoke English. Fares were very cheap when compared to the competition. Only German magazines/newspapers available. Would fly them again if I'm in Europe.,8/17/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Long,0,Bad: I flew many times between London and Istanbul always on business class. I have had enough of it. Their planes are old seats are most uncomfortable little leg room same seat as economy but with spare seat in the middle. They also always make you take shuttle bus to terminal both inbound and outbound most inconvenient. I had to help carrying the luggage up the steps for an elderly lady. Hate it they think it is a popular routes so why bother improving it! Wrote to customer service twice no response! Good: Better food and lounge than BA.,10/13/2014,1,1,3,1,1,1
A Rawling,1,We were not expecting much having previously flown Air Asia (not recommended!) so when we boarded the flight we were met with very professional friendly and approachable staff. Then we were served good food and wine had great access to a good list of films and other entertainment. We were very comfortable and well accommodated by the staff. I'd go so far as to say I enjoyed this flight!,10/25/2013,4,4,5,5,5,10
A Lord,1,Edinburgh to Palma (18/05/13) on the Sunwings aircraft that Thomson are using out of Edinburgh this year. The plane was comfortable better than the usual Thomson offerings supplied by Monarch that we've had previously. Cabin crew going out weren't too bad but coming back they seem to be more human and interacted with passengers. After a delayed take off from Edinburgh (1 hour delay) they announced that orders would be taken for any hot foods bacon baguettes seemed to be the order of the day only for staff to then come round telling most folk that they'd run out due to not getting the full quota of baguettes. Due to the plane being Canadian all the safety announcements were made in English and French which was different. On the return flight there were no announcements from the flight deck other which I thought was somewhat unusual and the seatbelt signs seemed to be activated after the turbulence not before!,6/7/2013,4,4,3,0,3,6
A Ray,0,"Expected Club world got Club Europe - the same as Economy on any decent airline. Food was okay, plied with alcohol if you wanted it. Must be the oldest aircraft in the fleet. No IFE other than a 24"" screen for the cabin. Was told by the ground crew that my qualifying international cabin bag needed to be checked in, not happy. It's been on international and domestic roll aboard other than on a turboprop. My colleague had the same. Officious and uncalled for. Exactly the same cabin bags were rolled aboard 4 days later on the return flight. Seats were economy class and cramped with little recline and less pitch than economy on many airlines. Why pay for Club Europe business class when you don't get it?",7/7/2015,1,1,2,NaN,3,1
A Lozhkin,0,DCA-JFK. Truly appalling experience. Apart from the 2.5 hrs delay due to which I missed a connection display of apathy indifference and condescension from multiple employees. The ground staff at DCA couldn't even advise if the incoming plane was in the air or not instead kept drip-feeding announcements of 30 mins delay each time. The lady didn't even have the decency to call JFK and explain my situation. At JFK in the middle of the night no AA staff was to be found finally a supervisor appeared at 5am and just sniggered at my problem of having missed the flight to Korea - not their problem apparently. The plane was shabby dirty and windows were barely kept together with a sticky tape.,9/24/2010,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Ray,1,"Short hop on older 737 with no IFE at dinner time. Left late. Didn't know what to expect. Mumbai domestic is fairly plain. Made to queue in an orderly fashion. Then queue again.

A Reeder,1,Flight 377 5/13/15 out to Vegas. Flight 340 5/27/15 back to Latrobe. We flew Spirit to Las Vegas from Latrobe PA. Great price free parking and we enjoyed the whole experience.

A Lynch,1,DUB-BRU-DUB good service and great value for money on this route. A321 almost 15 years old but clean and comfortable with excellent leather seats and adjustable head-rest. Ground service was competent and speedy and cabin crew were friendly professional and well groomed engaging with passengers. There is a newly updated menu with drinks and snacks available to purchase. I was disappointed to see that there is a now a more limited selection than previous versions of the menu but prices are still keen and quality is very good. All in all vastly superior to Ryanair when flying from Ireland to Belgium.,5/1/2013,5,5,4,3,4,8
A Reid,0,This was the worst set of flights I have ever taken. Both directions were over 4 hours and overnight however the seats were the narrowest I have ever sat in and fixed in place. The seats were so small that it was not possible to hold a book normally but to have to hold it up much closer to your face and with so little space that they did not have space for a normal tray which meant when food came round there was not space to also have anything to drink. The food was awful and struggled to eat any of the hot meals which were of course an extra charge. There was no entertainment full stop. This was an awful experience but then every step of the way with Thomas Cook was an awful experience and would not recommend them to anyone. Every seat on the plane was reduced room and non- recline so paying to upgrade is not an option either.,11/17/2014,1,1,1,1,2,NaN
A Maayer,1,DEL-HEL-VIE A330. New A330 with full flat seats. Food good crew professional. I missed my connection to VIE due to a storm in HEL (3h delay).

A Ricardo,1,Had two flights LIS-LHR and a Portugalia (Tap owned) MAD-LIS recently. TAP flight was steady great pilot. Delay of 30mins solved and arrived on time. Meal: ok for such short flight A320 is not a plane that I like a lot but its ok. Service with a smile. Portugalia's flight was on a Fokker 100 and I liked it a lot. Plane looks less cramped than the A320. Good service helpful crew. In check with PGA normal service. Smooth flight. Luggage: no problems.,7/14/2013,4,4,3,2,4,8
A Richards,1,"London Heathrow to Bangkok via Muscat return. Use of NO 1 lounge at Heathrow was very good indeed although quite busy. Food and drink were plentiful. Onboard A330-300 1-2-1 configuration so everyone has aisle access. Seat is extremely comfortable and a full 180 degree flat bed with 17"" monitor. Crew service and attentiveness excellent. Food was good quality and quantity spot on. Muscat and Bangkok lounges were excellent. Entertainment not very extensive with no new real releases of movies. One crew member remembered me by name on my return journey after 2 weeks and I found that impressive. Fast track immigration at BKK and LHR a huge bonus.",2/23/2012,5,5,4,4,5,9
A Macarron,0,We had a ticket to fly DAR-ZNZ but on arrival to DAR from NBO a member of the staff was waiting for us to inform us that the flight had been delayed - so much that they were putting us on another flight operated by a competitor. So we never got to fly with them but we were quite impressed at how they had arranged everything for us. The agent stayed with us at the gate until we departed. I thought it was great service.,4/20/2010,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,4
A Rigters,1,BHX to CMB and back. The first flight to CMB was awful we had to wait 2 hours more then expected I had a baby and my son with me and they did not offer my children any meals or food for the whole flight. My son was upset because he did not receive the small backpack with colouring pencils and a colouring book (which you normally get for kids). The return flight however was pleasant we did get food this time and the crew was friendly! We paid enough money for the ticket so I hope next time will be a lot better on both flights.,2/18/2014,2,3,1,3,3,5
A MacFarland,0,Brussels to Philadelphia on Christmas eve or at least we tried. Brussels Airlines was supposed to get us to London so we could get our connection with US Airways. Due to weather conditions flight got cancelled. I am not complaining about the cancellation weather conditions are beyond anyone's control however I am complaining about the lack of information and help given to us from this point on. We were rebooked re-cancelled they lost our luggage on the way and there is no way to get through to their luggage tracing department they just do not answer any calls! When you send an email to their Baggage department you do not get an answer either let alone an automated message saying they received your mail! It does not stop there. Brussels Airlines changed my return flight to London with US Airways without consulting me and decided to change it to return to Brussels even though I live in London. I still to this day do not know why! They had to add a flight to my itinerary so I could get home to London. To this day I still do not have my luggage and have not been contacted once. My emails and calls remain unanswered. I have never had to face such problems in all my previous travels with any airlines.,1/14/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Ritzau,1,Got the A380 from Dubai to Heathrow EK001. Loved the plane. Very new looking and swish! Toilets updated and cleaned regularly seats roomy and I am a big lady! Entertainment was great. Staff were a little harassed thought they were maybe understaffed as very different from earlier connecting flight. They still managed to get all the food delivered and drink runs done! Boarding was easy in Dubai despite this being or first venture outside of English speaking countries. Felt a little less special than at Adelaide but then that would be because in Adelaide we were the special ones at Dubai we were one of many! Plane was very quiet compared to the 777 a bit more clumsy on take off and landing though! I think this is more plane design issue. Food was outstanding. Very tasty and a lot of it!,10/1/2014,5,5,5,5,4,10
A Mackenzie,1,"CPH-BRS. Bag drop at Copenhagen T2 was fast, and our carry-on bags inspected for number and size. easyJet use the low-cost terminal F at Copenhagen airport, which is pretty sparten but well lit and clean. Having been marshalled at the gate, (with seating for only 15 people travelling in Plus, and no seating for Economy), it is just a short walk to the aircraft for boarding, which goes smoothly as both front and rear doors are used. In bad weather this exposure could be slightly unpleasant, as bottle-necks would mean waiting on the aircraft steps. However, all is good on board. The cabin is clean and tidy, the flight staff good humoured, and the blessing of a non-reclining seat-back so that the passenger in front of you cannot recline their seat as soon as possible, and perhaps leave it in that position for the whole of the flight â€“  wonderful. BRS to CPH. Bag drop opened 3 hours before the flight time which is a boon. The inbound aircraft was slightly late, and therefore we could witness the arrival passengers struggle across the tarmac against heavy rain in their scanty holiday clothes. Luckily we had our travel umbrellas as, in addition, we were held up on the aircraft steps for a minute or two. Again, a cheerful crew who dealt with their cabin duties in a professonal manner. The captain made up for the late start, and we arrived on time in Copenhagen.",7/26/2015,4,4,3,NaN,5,9
A Roberts,1,London Gatwick to Madrid in Oct 2012. Ordered extra legroom seats for 20 euros each way checked in online too. Check-in was quick boarding was on time and took off at the correct time - no delays. Staff onboard were able to speak both Spanish and English and sold a range of snacks drinks and other items - very reasonably priced and able to take credit cards. Flew on a Boeing 737-800 and an Embraer 195 jet aircraft. Flight itself was faultless - very comfortable seating heating in cabin was very good - excellent airline will look forward to flying them again!,10/29/2012,5,5,5,0,5,10
A Robinson,1,Heathrow to Colombo (UL504) and return (UL503). Business class on outward leg to take advantage of the flat bed on an overnight flight (7 rows with 2-2-2 configuration i.e. 42 seats all of which were occupied). Tried repeatedly to check in online but got an automated message that this was not possible. BA desk at Manchester confirmed they could not through check pax or luggage. Although the check in with Sri Lankan at HRW was smooth the baggage collection on arrival from Manchester transfer between terminals and so called â€˜fast-trackâ€™ security was a nightmare taking almost 3 hours. Lounge in LHR Terminal 4 (shared with Gulf Air) was one of the best we have used â€“ spacious and relaxing environment. Boarding was a bit chaotic. Families with children called first no preference given to business class. Onboard service and environment was similar to typical business/club class with many other airlines with the exception of the entertainment system (very limited selection not easy to use poor quality sound). Crew very attentive drinks served frequently good choice of western and Sri Lankan meals for dinner and breakfast. Flat bed was very comfortable. Good Bulgari amenity kit. Returned in economy class (2-4-2 configuration). No queue for check in at Colombo and were allocated requested seats. Surprised that we were automatically through checked to Manchester even though we were overnighting at HRW. CMB airport was a reasonable size with a good selection of shops. Airport has a limited number of toilets and these can be very busy at certain times. Clear boarding announcements. Good welcome and attentiveness from crew. No amenity kit despite this being a 12 hour flight. Seat pitch and width is not significantly better or worse than many scheduled economy seats. There was no foot rest. Overall there are issues because the planes are dated but otherwise the cost of business and economy class service represents good value compared with other airlines. Would definitely choose Sri Lankan again for a direct flight.,3/5/2013,4,4,4,2,5,8
A MacMillan,1,Yangon to Bangkok . Although the flight left two hours late we were kept well informed in the departure lounge at Yangon International Airport. The plane was a Druk Air A319 with Bhutanese flight crew and Myanmar cabin crew. The plane was spotlessly clean and the service and meal provided both excellent.,11/15/2009,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Magowan,1,LHR - Miami. On an older 747-400 aircraft the interior was a little shabby and dated but generally clean. IFE worked no problem but the entire row in front of me all had to be moved as their screens did not work. Plenty of meals and refreshments offered quality of the food was generally good but the options were limited. In general a fairly pleasant flight however the only down side was the surly attitude of the flight attendants.,9/2/2013,4,3,4,5,2,5
A Roblou,1,"Economy London Gatwick to Osaka via Beijing in mid-August and back via Beijing but to London Heathrow in early September. Cheaper than the others by Â£200 + a seat. Timings of flights excellent and quick with only 2 hour turnaround in Beijing. Planes Airbus A330-200 ok with 2-4-2 pattern. Seats no worse than many other airlines in economy - maybe an inch more than some. Food quality ok. Wine only served at end of main meal! Staff fine. Loos ok. Entertainment a bit limited and one seat back terminal ropey and you need the double mono adapter. Flights all pretty much on time. Beijing transfer is a bit tricky first time - go to the ""transfer passenger"" queue on the far right of all other queues looks slow but works ok then down escalator and back through security. We fly long haul every year sometimes several times and for the money and on this experience we thought Air China were fine.",9/9/2012,5,3,3,2,4,7
A Maher,0,Tripoli to Bengazi. A one hour flight that turned into a dreadful 4 hour experience. 1.5 hours late sitting inside the domestic terminal with no reason whatsoever. Bussed to the plane which was a 727-200 that looks like a dead bird from the outside and was very hot from the inside. Torn and non adjustable seats tables kept opening and no seat number assigned to passengers - serve yourself! Before take off the captain explained why the AC was not working well the APU on the aircraft was not working. Long story short - I am a very frequent flyer but flying on that old 722 gave me the creeps!,5/3/2007,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Rodriguez,1,Took this flight long haul from JFK to Poland. The seats were small and the leg room is very small. I usually travel this route through Aer Lingus which has a lot more space and more comfortable but unfortunately they discontinued this route. The flight attendants for my flight was rude and not nice. They didn't smile and if you asked for anything it seemed like you were bothering them. The food was the worst. Would not use this airline again. The price was very good though.,4/16/2014,3,2,2,4,1,4
A Maile,1,Jakarta - Taipei. Garuda now have a dedicated business class check in area at Jakarta airport once checked in an agent escorts you directly to the lounge completes your departure card and deals with immigration formalities for you returning 10 minutes later with your passport stamped. Outbound flight was overnight and not particularly comfortable as they use B737-800 which has very limited recline even in business class so difficult to sleep. Service was good (and the J cabin was full) but quite limited as most passengers just wanted to sleep. Substantial breakfast served before arrival into Taipei. Return flight was daytime and very nice. Garuda uses the CAL Dynasty lounge at Taipei airport. Snacks served on take off and then a full lunch service a couple of hours later. Champagne and decent selection of wines offered. Given a fast pass immigration card so no need to queue upon arrival at Soekarno Hatta which was a big bonus as queues at immigration were very long. Business class luggage was delivered quite quickly by hand to a priority luggage bay near carousel. Overall very good indeed and very reasonable fare of USD 770 return.,11/15/2012,5,3,4,4,4,9
A Rosen,0,March 8th 2014 myself and 6 family members and friends were scheduled to fly at 3.15pm from Punta Cana to Newark. Of course the usual 45 minute delay in boarding was to be expected but by the time we got onto the tarmac and boarded the plane there was additional 2 hour delay. Finally by 9pm 6 hours after we were supposed to depart we were told the flight was canceled and would be rebooked the following day on flight 1762 at 2.20pm. Back through customs back to pickup up our luggage and then most of the passengers went onto a bus to a hotel to be returned the next day where the process was started again. 2 more hours to repeat check-in of luggage security and immigration. To add insult to injury United canceled another scheduled flight on Sunday and stranded 200 other customers so we could fly out. Boarding in the 90-degree heat they revealed to us that there were new mechanical problems with the replacement plane. They delivered us back to the terminal where we sat like cattle again without any information at all. This was by far the worst travel experience I have had in 40 years of traveling. United airlines gave only an empty apology by text message on our arrival in Newark referring us to a website to claim a minor token gift which could never compensate us for disastrously poor customer service. The 2 lost luggage bags that arrived 24 hours after we arrived in Punta Cana the week before seemed almost trivial in comparison. What a shame!,3/18/2014,1,3,2,2,5,1
A Makiol,1,Flew BNE-ICN-LHR return. Excellent on all four flights. I have flown KE a couple of times before and it's great to see that their high standards have remained in place. Cabin crew are wonderful very attentive and friendly. All meal options were available on all flights and it's nice have proper stainless steel cutlery. Hot towels distributed and regular drink and snack runs made throughout the flight. IFE may be limited for some however it didn't really bother me. Seats comfortable and leg room is among the best for economy class. Bathrooms were regularly cleaned and well stocked. The overnight in Seoul is very well organised provided with 4-star accommodation and really helps with jet leg. I noticed lots of fellow passengers were impressed with the layover experience also. Korean Air is a great airline and I will continue to support them.,11/20/2014,5,5,4,3,5,9
A Ross,0,I paid extra to have shorter lay over times. Instead we were stuck on the San Juan airport for 5 hours because the plane was late and we missed our connecting flight. That was on the way to St Thomas. On our way home we were delayed again because they had maintenance problems. Sat in the airport another 3 hours than 4 hours then 5 hours before they finally got us on a plane.,9/10/2014,1,3,3,4,5,NaN
A Rowling,1,Clean plane. Pleasant crew. Food and entertainment are good. Seats were narrow and not well padded but considering that planes are designed as mass public transport in the air - can't complain too much. We really liked Zurich Airport as a transit point to other destinations. It is small modern and not at all chaotic like some of the bigger transit airports. If you land during the day and have a window seat you get a fabulous view of the Alps. Would use this airline again.,5/16/2014,4,3,4,4,5,9
A Makki,0,Bangkok to Yangon return. Departing journey was OK plane interior was quite shabby and needed a refit. The food could have been better. FAs were good at their job very friendly. The return flight was better the interior was better with Air Bagan logos they served a continental breakfast which was very good. There was no problem with weight excess baggage was waived.,11/16/2008,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,6
A Rutkauskaite,0,The flight from Eindhoven was late one hour. For flight from Vilnius they were very strict for luggage and service was rude. I would not recommend. Of course it is cheap but there are other cheap airlines so why bother.,4/25/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,2
A Malman,0,"Overall based on a round-trip flight between IAD and SFO I would give United 0 stars. On the outbound leg there was a medical emergency on-board and the United flight crew was totally unprepared to handle the situation. If a medical kit was on-board it wasn't made available to the medical personnel who tried to provide assistance and it took 15 minutes for the Flight attendant to bring a wet towel to help cool the patient down. Our return flight was delayed by almost 5 hours with not even ""we apologize"" for the delay from United. Then our bags were placed on a different flight that didn't arrive until 1 hours after our flight and the bags didn't show up at the airport until 4 hours after we landed. Again no apologies from United. then we got numerous texts from United about the status of our bags. One even claimed the bags arrived at IAD 2 hours before we did. Most of the customer support folks at the Baggage Claim customer support were surly and not the kind of people who should be working in customer support.",2/24/2015,1,2,1,1,1,1
A S Moulic,0,"Our family of 5 went to Boracay for vacation last week (starting May 16). Manila-Kalibo on May 16 Kalibo-Manila on May 19 5.15pm. Trip going to Kalibo was ok however I was shocked to receive an email advisory from PAL on Saturday night at 6.35pm that we have been re-booked from our May 20 5.15pm flight to May 20 6.30am instead! It is impossible to get from Boracay island to Kalibo by that hour. CS agent and supervisor were insisting we either take the 6.30am May 20 flight or do a ""go-show"" for their 8pm or 10pm or 12.15am flights. I had to stay on the line with their CS Supervisor until he finally got us confirmed seats on May 20 4.15pm flight. In all of this all PAL could say was ""sorry for the inconvenience"". I will avoid this airline from now on.",5/21/2013,0,0,0,0,0,NaN
A Sagar,0,Roundtrip NYC-LHR (technical stop) - KWI-MAA. Booked Economy for the cheapest deal from NYC to Chennai. Both onward and return flights delayed by more than an hour.

A Mani,1,First time on this airline was quite hesitant at first but price was too good to let go. Flew from Montreal to Paris and back on 747. Checked in luggage and had a carry on. On the way to Paris - sat on upper deck On the way back lower deck far back on an aisle seat. Both flights on time (Paris flight was actually early). No trouble with luggage. Food was decent with excellent staff. Overall very nice experience - would definitely recommend.,10/18/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
A Sahni,1,On par with all the reviews for Vueling. We flew Vueling from BCN to VGO domestic flight with in Spain the OB flight was on-time and no issues with taking carry-on bags on the plane. On return from VGO the flight was delayed without sending notices via the Vueling mobile app. Arrived at the airport on time and proceeded to check-in and was stopped by Vueling agent to pay for carry on bag. Informed the Vueling agent that coming from BCN Vueling did not charge me for the carry-on agent could care less. Anyways paid with trusted credit card so I could call them once back home in the USA. Got to the gate and notice all the locals with the same size carry-on bags as mine were not made to check them in. Some had bigger carry-on bags that could be classified as checked in luggage. While at the gate no information that the only flight flown by Vueling on Saturday was delayed by two hours. As the night went on in VGO we went back to Iberia which was handling the Vueling flight as the Vueling ground crew left the airport. Told flight will come but if it gets cancelled you are on your own for hotel. Note Vigo is small town lacking hotels. Finally the plane arrived from Barcelona with a fresh crew and made a quick turn around. Since the flight was delayed 2+ hours by the time we left Vigo it was now 11pm. We arrived back at 1am having to wait for Vueling to located ground crew in Barcelona as most the Vueling planes had already returned for the night and the airport while it is open 24 hours keeps limited people on hand after 12am. The hold in Barcelona was not acceptable being that Barcelona is Vueling's hub. I would fly Vueling again but I will fly them with being sure to take morning flights in case of any delays also keep my trusted Credit Card on hand to dispute carry on charge for not being local.,7/24/2015,5,4,NaN,NaN,4,6
A Maraey,0,Roundtrip flight from Cairo to New York JFK with connection in Abu Dhabi. The problem happened with returning flight from JFK to Cairo specifically the second flight from AUH to CAI. The flights was supposed to take off at 00.50 24th November 2014. We boarded the aircraft but we stayed 2-3 hours due to fog after which we were transferred back to the airport. The fog cleared at around 7am. Nevertheless there was no real updates about the flight. The flight took off at 1:00 PM after 12 hours from the designated take off time. After 13 hours travel from New York and 5 hours transit in AUH was only offered a meal. No hotel provided. We were forced to wait 12 hours expecting take off at any time making a nap risky. I'll never book with Etihad again.,12/10/2014,2,3,4,4,1,1
A Sanford,1,5 October 2014 FD315 and D7 222. I had already booked a flight from BKK to SYD on another airline but had to cancel and find another flight closer to my departure date. AirAsia had a business class ticket available departing from Don Mueang at an excellent price so I bought it. The first flight from DMK to KUL didn't have a designated business class seating section but my seat was in the 3rd row so that was convenient. The flight from KUL to SYD did have a separate business class seating area with chairs that reclined almost flat for sleeping. The chair width was ample. Although a 180 degree flatbed would have been better AirAsia's was decent and I was able to sleep fairly well. The service was excellent and we were given extra snack treats. I will definitely fly AirAsia business class for an overnight flight again as long as it is affordable for me.,11/3/2014,5,3,4,4,5,8
A Marc,0,Flew Manila-Melbourne-Manila A330-300 economy 3-3-3 seat configuration. Service is good. Plane is new but I find the seats very narrow and uncomfortable. Can't avoid to brush elbows with your seat mate. I used to take PAL for many years to help economy but I will be avoiding this new A330 by all means. The old A330 and A340 with 2-4-2 seats are more comfortable than this new A330.,4/22/2015,2,2,3,1,4,3
A Santopoli,0,"Flew MEL-CHC-ZQN-AKL-MEL A320 and ATR72. Legroom on the Trans Tasman flights are a joke in fact the domestic A320 aircraft have more legroom! Movies on the Trans Tasman flights are quite dated and definitely nothing current on show. Catering for those who paid for it was just ok nothing special. Service by crew was ok I missed out on drinks (cabin crew didn't make it to my row) even though I paid for ""The Works"" fare. This experience certainly does not convince me to fly them long haul I would definitely recommend Qantas on the Trans Tasman flights.",11/20/2013,3,2,3,3,3,5
A Saraiva,1,"I flew Dubai to Bangkok via Colombo and return - Business class. Three legs on Airbus A330 and one on Airbus A321 and I found all aircraft cabins to look a bit tired. All flights on time except the first leg Dubai-Colombo about 40min late. However this first leg was the most pleasant flight - very friendly and welcoming crew they were eager to please and handled very well a group of 4 passengers in Business class who were being loud and drinking too much. On the other 3 legs the crew varied from ""not so friendly"" to friendly but unprofessional. The food was tasty and portions quite generous I had my champagne glass topped up without asking! Their inflight entertainment was not the best but that didn't bother me personally as I have my own tablet. The headphones and blankets are not really premium quality just the same as in economy class. Even though the toilets were kept clean and fresh on all 4 legs I found the cabins were not very clean. On the return from Bangkok to Dubai I had a 18hr layover in Colombo and SriLankan provided a car and a room at an airport hotel. The lounge at Colombo airport was OK nothing special but pleasant enough.",12/10/2014,3,4,4,2,4,7
A Mark,0,London Heathrow to Vancouver via Toronto. Was looking forward to trying the 787 Dreamliner. Well what a disappointment. Firstly Air Canada somehow managed to offload us from the flight in London and this was only realised when they scanned our boarding cards at the gate. In the meantime Air Canada had sold our assigned seats to someone else and after much stress we were eventually given seats right at the back of the plane. No apology from any of the crew on board for the stress caused by a problem entirely their own fault. Underwhelmed by the 787 looks like any other new aircraft on the inside the seating is narrow due to the tight 9 across seating and the plane seemed quite noisy. This accompanied by the typically forgettable Air Canada service meant I left that plane with nothing good to say about Air Canada. Connection at Toronto was tight due to our late running inbound flight. Our 777 to Vancouver had been swapped from a high density one to a standard one with less seats you can imagine the chaos at the gate as the flight was now oversold. Again more seating changes for us and we were now seated in economy middle aisle instead of Premium Economy. Overall a totally unpleasant experience made more stressful by Air Canada at every stage. I don't need this when I fly and will now take my business elsewhere.,12/18/2014,1,2,1,3,1,1
A Sargeant,1,Moscow - Abu Dhabi - Bangkok. A good trip although check in staff member seemed not to speak English. Flight was a little late leaving Moscow and arriving in Abu Dhabi which made the transit a little stressful as it was not clear that I and my luggage would make the second flight. Cabin staff were friendly and attentive but no one spoke Russian on the Moscow - Abu Dhabi sector. Food and wine were good but the service a little slow especially on the Abu Dhabi sector where I was trying to get a reasonable amount of sleep. Both planes were good and clean and with seats being fully flat beds were restful and spacious. The IFE was good on both planes and we were permitted to use the IFE until we had landed. The airport in Abu Dhabi was undergoing extension/renovation and a bus was used to transport passengers to the terminal. The lateness in arrival meant that the plane was about to board so it was not possible to eat in the lounge and then only sleep on the second flight. Here supper rather than dinner was late being served so valuable sleep time was lost. Bag did make the second flight but it was one of the last off the plane in Bangkok so received zero priority!,9/18/2013,4,5,4,5,4,8
A Markland,0,"AF 522 CDG to Cape Town 2/2/15. Service diabolical seat uncomfortable food and beverage very average - all in all the most underwhelming of experiences just like BA in their nationalised period. The most extraordinary experience was to be told by 2 stewardesses over an hour between them to put out my reading light and go to sleep. 58 years ago aged 6 I might have accepted it but how utterly inappropriate behaviour. The first one actually reached past me and switched it off (this was maybe 30 minutes after they dimmed cabin lights after very poor food service). An hour or so later the second one tried and got a very brusque ""go away and leave me alone"" from me. This stunned her into saying ""you can't speak to me like that"" to which I responded ""I have now go away"". When did it become company policy for AF to treat customers like 6 year olds? Probably the most unsatisfactory flight I've ever taken.",3/4/2015,2,1,2,4,1,2
A Marshall,0,LHR to BKK via Muscat - All flights on time and a short layover in Muscat food wasn't that great on the way out but return leg was nice. This is the first time I have used Oman I usually use Etihad or Emirates but I probably wont chose Oman again until they open the new airport in Muscat. The reason been there are no airbridges to get on and off the plane they use busses. This makes boarding a lot longer sat in a waiting area with no toilets or any facilities Also as the plane is at a remote stand there is no air conditioning until take off and with 300 passengers sat waiting at 45C it is unbearable making it very uncomfortable. 3 times I had to ask for a coffee the service was a hit and miss too. I expected more from Oman and they need to do a little work to compete with other middle east airlines.,7/31/2014,4,3,3,3,3,5
A Sargeant,1,Bangkok - Brunei - Melbourne. Both flights lefts and landed on time. Royal Brunei is a dry airline and no alcohol was served. The food was quite tasty and the portions very adequate. The short flight from Bangkok had older style Business seats and the cabin was almost full. The inflight entertainment was OK and the staff were very friendly and helpful. From Brunei to Melbourne the cabin was lightly loaded and the staff service was very good. The cabin and toilets were clean and comfortable. The entertainment was good although the screens are a little on the small size and the technology a little old. The plane landed early and I discovered after clearing Immigration and Quarantine that I had left my glasses on the flight. I met cabin staff outside the restricted area and they told me that the glasses had been found and how to get them back. I fly with Royal Brunei once to twice a year to Bangkok and then return. The staff have always provided good service the entertainment has been adequate and the food enjoyable. I find the value for money to be exceptionally good and that is why I continue to fly them.,9/17/2013,5,4,4,4,4,8
A Martin,0,We flew from London to Manila via Shanghai. The service on the aircraft was very poor with most of the cabin crew having very limited English. The food was just about edible. Getting served was very hit and miss with some crew just walking up and down the aisle with drinks and not asking each passenger if they wanted anything. It was up to passengers to attract their attention and many time people were just ignored. Some staff were friendly some barely hid their contempt for the passengers. We booked a baby bassinet but it wasn't provided and the cabin crew couldn't even understand what we wanted when we asked so we had to spend a 13 hour flight with a baby on our laps. No children's meals were provided even though we booked them. We checked the baby buggy at the gate in Heathrow. When we got to Shanghai it had disappeared and it took us several hours of speaking to unhelpful staff to get it back. Shanghai airport is a huge gloomy depressing place with zero facilites beyond basic seating and horrifically expensive shops. 8GBP for a fruit juice. All in all the worst airline I have flown with by a wide margin. For an international airline the lack of language skills and training of the staff is inexcusable and the staff's attitude to the people who pay their wages is totally unacceptable.,1/11/2015,2,3,1,3,1,NaN
A Saunders,1,LGW to Havana via Holguin and Havana to LGW. Outgoing flight left an hour late but arrived on time. The food was fine and we got one alcoholic drink. Staff were friendly and as the plane was not full there was plenty of room to sleep over 3 seats. Toilets were fine. No inflight entertainment. On return the flight left on time. There was inflight entertainment. Staff were friendly. Toilets clean and the food again fine although you got what you were given. Able to spread out as the plane was not full. Given it was an economy cabin I thought that it was value for money.,2/13/2012,4,4,3,3,4,8
A Martin,1,"I'd never normally fly with someone like Thomas Cook but only did so because very few low-cost airlines go to Tunisia. Their website seems quite long-winded but would recommend doing on-line check-in as essentially jumped the queue at the airport desk. Reserved seating was horrifically expensive but we did it anyway. Unfortunately we had one of the older A321's both ways so the cabin was looking a bit old and tired but adequate for a 2hr 40min flight but on the plus side cabin crew were very friendly. Didn't bother with in-flight meals but good enough selection of drinks and snacks, and averagely priced as airlines go. Both the outbound and inbound flights were on time which was a bonus as have heard bad things about Thomas Cook's flight punctuality. Would fly them again but probably only if I had to as they're no better than the low-cost carriers who even with the extras are considerably cheaper.",6/15/2015,2,3,3,NaN,5,6
A Scheel,1,Frankfurt-Rome-Tblisi. Check-in Frankfurt is done together with Air France/KLM in T2 - very efficient. Frankfurt-Rome on time with beverage service. Crew okay. No newspapers on this flight. Rome-Tblisi at odd Hours arrived in Tblisi at 5 am. Flight only 70% booked so I had plenty of space. Food was good though cold only. IFE limited. Baggage took quite a long time to arrive on the belt. Would fly again.,1/2/2013,4,4,3,2,4,8
A Mary,0,"Having flown with Emirates and Eithad, I was looking forward to a good service from Gulf Air. This was my first experience flying with them and probably the last. The food served was horrible. The air stewards and stewardess could not speak clear English hence, were rude to most of the passengers who could not understand what they were saying. They were not very efficient or attentive to passengers. I had to call them twice to be given a blanket since it was very cold onboard. The inflight entertainment movie selection was very poor when compared to Emirates  who have a better selection. ",7/27/2015,1,1,1,1,1,2
A Schmit,0,"FLL to MSP and return. Staff must've taken how to not smile and treat everyone like cattle as part of their classes because on every flight we took (there were 4 total for the round trip) all attendants were almost disgruntled employees. They looked like they ""had"" to be there. An elderly woman who couldn't sit with her young grandchild who was very nervous about that (because of their no assigned seats policy) was delighted when another customer volunteered to switch seats with her before they even started the seat belt instructions and the first flight attendant reprimanded them and then I saw her tell the second attendant who rolled her eyes. Come on that made the flight more enjoyable for everyone plus what was the big deal to them? Our soft drinks took almost the whole flight to get to us and then they ask for your garbage right after you start drinking it. The seats are comfortable enough but there is no perks to paying the extra $12 a ticket for the early bird check in unless you are just partial to a window seat. I got A30-36 boarding most times which is after the first A group picks all the leg room seats. The only thing I like is that you can control whether or not you sit in front of kids if you don't want to you find a seat in front of adults already sitting.",7/29/2014,3,4,2,NaN,1,4
A Matskevich,0,"My wife and I bought a round trip ticket Tbilisi - Mestia in the Republic of Georgia. The plane was scheduled to leave at 11 am but was supposedly delayed. I say supposedly because no one bothered to inform us. At around 1 pm one of the passengers went to the ticket office to remind them that after a two-hour delay you must provide a lunch for stranded passengers. The manager angrily replied ""OK we will bring you water"" but never did. The plane left at 4 pm. Two days later we were supposed to fly back at 4 pm. At 1 pm we were informed that the flight was cancelled and told to come to the airport to pick up the money. How do we get to Tbilisi from this very remote town high in the mountains with no other transportation except a private car that we didn't have?",12/5/2012,2,3,0,0,1,NaN
A Schwarz,0,Munich to Bucharest. I booked Tarom often in the past for this trip. However the service is getting worse every time. They serve now only a sandwich that is very dry and give you the usual drinks - which is still ok. There were about 25% empty seats where some at the exit row were not taken. I am quite tall (202 cm) and have problems to fit into the normal seats. Now I wanted to change my seat with one at the exit row. The cabin crew member was very arrogant and unfriendly. He told me to back to my seat as I am booked on this one. My height was for him no argument - he even told me at business class I have even more space. With Tarom you get from A to B. That's it!,10/10/2012,2,1,2,1,1,2
A May,1,Heathrow to Delhi. Very easy check-in at Heathrow using terminal 4 is great because it's a small terminal so queues are far shorter for check-in and security than in other terminals. My flight was delayed an hour. Had good inflight service and the food and entertainment was adequate. My main problem with this airline compared to using other airlines is the fellow passengers. Be prepared to put up with people pushing their way forward at the boarding gate and for a relatively noisy flight. So although the airline is fine if you can get an equivalent flight on this route I'd take it.,6/12/2012,4,3,4,4,5,7
A Scott,0,Sydney to London return. Food poor and often only one option by the time they reached our seat staff efficient but not friendly. Shared overhead tvs showed no english movies (Chinese ones had English subtitles but difficult to read them from a distance). No warning about 3 hour delays but did offer food voucher. Wouldn't fly with them again will pay the extra money for service.,10/13/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,4
A Maynard,0,"First time I have used Germanwings for connecting flights (via Hamburg). The APP does not work properly. They are unable to issue both boarding cards on check in causing unnecessary inconvenience. Their ""Live"" Twitter response averages 24 hours to reply. Cabin crew spend most time behind front galley curtains. Also fail to do proper cabin secure checks prior to landing. Seats new ultra thin models OK for short flights. Seat pitch OK on the extra space seats. Smart fare snack boring and repetitive. They have taken over a lot of Lufthansa routes and to be honest they are not really geared up for it. Poor ground handling and communications.",5/28/2014,3,3,2,0,2,5
A Scott,0,We booked a holiday to Benidorm with David Urquhart Travel. I specifically booked a flight which was supposed to be leaving Manchester Airport at 2pm on 11th May 2014. A few days before we were due to fly we received a telephone call to say that the flight had been put to 5.30 pm which we were not very happy about. When we arrived at the airport we were informed at check in that the flight would not be leaving until 7.40 pm. We eventually departed at 8.45 pm 6 hours and 45 minutes after our original time. Most of the other passengers were grumbling and it seemed pretty clear that the original flight of 2pm had been taken off. We finally arrived at our hotel at 2 am local time after setting off from our home at 2 pm the previous day. The seats were so closely packed together that my knees were up against the seat in front we could barely get the trays down in front of us and it was impossible to recline the seats as that would have given no room for the people behind us. To add to this the stewards wheeling the trolleys met right against our seats and were there for about 20 minutes constantly opening the metal doors to get out items and letting the doors bang against our seats.,5/28/2014,2,1,4,0,2,3
A Mayorga,0,MTY to CUN via MEX. MTY to MEX flight was delayed and they didn't do anything about it so I missed my connection to CUN then customer service gave me the run around and tried to charge me MXN$300 to put me on waiting lists for flights they clearly knew were oversold. Aeromexico left me stranded in the airport overnight and couldn't be bothered to offer board and a meal. Hadn't it been for my helpful travel agency I might as well been left there for 3 days until my returning flight to MTY. MEX to MTY was delayed as well as apparently the crew was stuck in TIJ. I'll never fly Aeromexico again.,11/11/2013,1,1,1,1,1,1
A Semmelroth,0,"If you are looking for a cheap easy flight look elsewhere. Cebu lists low rates to get you started on purchasing a ticket by listing a super low price. By the time you're finished making the reservation it might be quite a bit more and by the time they finish ""nickle-and-diming"" you for all the ""extras"" you will have paid more for the flight. In my case I got a round trip ticket from Japan to Manila for what I thought would only be about $300 USD. By the time I finished checking in for my return flight I will have spent more than $700 USD in total. For an international flight that provided no food or water without extra payment. Everything about the flight is cheap. There are no movies no pillows no blankets if buy food on the flight they hand you a hot aluminium case of food (street vendor style) without a tray like other airlines do which makes it all to easy for things to drop away under other seats. In my case I only had so many Philippine Pesos left so I could only afford a dish to eat but couldn't get any water or anything at all to drink. Take my advice if you want a well priced flight that has transparent policies provides food and water during long international flights has movies to watch provides comfort in the cabin (with bedding and providing liquids to drink) choose another airline: for example ANA Singapore Air JAL United. I've travelled to over 30 countries. Cebu was one of the more expensive flights I've taken (final price) and the value for money was the absolute worst.",9/22/2014,1,2,1,1,3,1
A McCabe,1,YYZ-GLA-YYZ economy class to GLA and Club back to YYZ. Plane left on time both directions  service was very good and cabin staff did a fine job cabin service was excellent food was ok typical plane food but no worse than any other airline I have flown.

A Mccook,1,"Flew in and out of Trenton from St. Augustine. A little nervous after reading review however our experience was great. I didn't go in with high expectations and was very pleased with the outcome. First we flew Classic Plus which allowed more leg room (my son is 6'3"" and needs extra space). This allowed us to check a bag each and have carry on for free (in addition to the allowed personal item). The seats were roomy and comfy. The staff at each airport was friendly (we arrived 1.5 hours before the flight with boarding passes printed at home as instructed). Had read horrible reviews of Trenton but found it very nice though small. Restrooms available at the gate a nice little eatery upstairs (before security). If you plan well and read the fine print you should have no complaints. It was 100 times better than my latest flight on United to Newark last month.",8/11/2014,4,5,4,4,4,8
A Seymour,0,Flew from London Gatwick to Prague on the 6/6/2015. Flight was great no delays however when the drinks trolley came round I asked for a tea for my husband and a boiled water and lemon for myself and was told that I could not have a boiled water as I had my own tea. An assumption was made that I was going to scam them out of paying the cost of a cup of tea. However that is what I drink. I was then given a boiled water and a tea bag separately and told that it would cost Â£2.50 the cost of a tea even though that is not what I wanted. When I said I was not going to pay that amount for hot water it was taken back and poured away. Someone explain the logic of this to me. Really happy to pay a contribution to cover the cost of the cup etc but really!,6/6/2015,2,4,2,0,4,3
A McEneaney,0,Flew the DUB-ORD route. I was disappointed with the movie selection offered by the in-flight entertainment. Compared to Delta there were far fewer movies to choose from and they were not current titles. Expect ones you've already seen 5 years ago. The hot meal was the usual chicken or beef options and was nothing to write home about. The pre-landing snack was a flapjack. They give you a knife and fork to eat it bizarrely. I guess this airline just loves wasting money. The armrests between seats do not go all the way up to prevent passengers lying down on a row of four. Annoying if you want to catch a quick nap. Overall I was disappointed with the flight given how much Aer Lingus charge for a one-way. I'll try another airline for the return journey.,4/23/2014,2,3,3,2,2,5
A Mclean,1,Air Pacific now Fiji Air went from Melbourne - Nadi return over Christmas. The plane took off on time with the new cabin fit out on the Airbus the seats recline flat with lots of space the screen in fixed position with an easy use remote control.

A Shahrul,0,Flew from KUL-PEK in early April. It is understandable that when the weather is not that good the flight will be delayed. However it took them ages to sort things out before departure. I was one of the last few passengers to board and yet we waited onboard for quite sometime before the plane started moving. The portions for the inflight food are getting less and less every year. They don't carry enough spare food for purchase. Cabin crews showed no emotion when serving.,6/9/2014,3,2,2,0,3,5
A McNeill,0,VLC-AMS. The boarding arrangements appear to be poorly managed with little evidence of co-ordination or teamwork. The already delayed flight was subjected to additional delay because of the inefficient boarding system. Cabin crew stood aside as passengers took their time to place their luggage while blocking the aisle. There is little sense of urgency or purpose on the part of the crew. I narrowly missed a connecting flight in AMS as a result.,3/12/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,3
A Shatskikh,0,On September 7 2013 300 hundred people with small children were kept for 4 hours in Sheremetevo because the aircraft and crew were waiting the group of transit passengers. (Flight SU 0102). It was the difficult long flight to New York - 9.5 hours plus 4 hours delay. Many passengers among these 300 hundred people lost their connections. It is shameful. My seat was between two large men and it was very uncomfortable I had only a half seat for myself. I will avoid Aeroflot flights since this event.,9/11/2013,1,1,3,4,3,NaN
A McNicol,0,BNK-SYD all good until arrived in Sydney on an outer bay with no air bridge. Apparently an A320 can arrive at the airport on schedule and the ground staff not notice! The captain announced over the pa that the ground staff seemed unaware the aircraft had arrived and he had radioed for stairs so passengers could disembark the aircraft! Travelling on the Qantas group these days is death by a thousand cuts - you never know what service will be cut next - but surely no stairs to disembark the aircraft is taking it a bit far!,11/6/2013,3,3,0,0,3,NaN
A Sheehan,1,My transatlantic flight by SATA was late. I still had to go through customs and security again to make my TAP Portugal flight 536 from Lisbon to Berlin. When I got off the SATA flight the board said final call for my TAP Portugal flight and I knew there was no way I could make it. But then a well-dressed TAP Portugal employee called for Berlin customers and put me at the front of the customs and security lines. I ran to the gate and made it!,5/31/2015,5,4,4,3,5,10
A McNicol,1,SIN-DVO-SIN. This is a gem of an airline I have used this service to Davao on many occasions and always been extremely impressed with the staff food and aircraft comfort. When you consider that this is the only direct service into Davao from outside the Philippines it represents great value for money when compared to having to transit either Manila or Cebu.,1/8/2014,5,5,5,2,5,10
A Shkaruba,0,BUD-SVO-KJA (roundtrip). Aeroflot inflight service was fine although staff could have been better trained and their English command was poor. Transfer in SVO is the Europe worst with the most confusing pointers impossibly slow passport control bizarre security check and no interest from staff to make the transfer more comfortable.,12/11/2011,3,3,3,1,2,3
A Meikle,0,"Check-in was very good. The woman who dealt with us was very personable. However the mood changed when I walked on to the plane and saw how closely positioned the seats were. I had read previous complaints about the legroom from passengers that were 5' 2"" (I'm 6' 2"") so I wasn't expecting to be able to stretch out but I was still taken aback by just how close the seats were. Flight was significantly uncomfortable because of this and many people stood up during the flight. Plane was a 757. Cabin crew were very pleasant however they did attempt to sell various silly things throughout the flight. Flight duration was 4.5 hours and any longer would've become quite unbearable. Flight back was delayed 1 hr 45 mins but being a night flight it was very quiet and seemed more comfortable. Plenty of empty seats on the return and the crew allowed passengers to move where they wished once the flight was at a certain height. The film only had sound up to row 20 and the aroma from the food made you wonder what it actually was. The expensive drinks bad food hard sell and a film without sound I can easily live with but the leg room is a major issue and cannot be ignored when reviewing this airline. It made the journey quite uncomfortable and because of this issue I would recommend others to find an alternative if possible.",8/6/2013,2,1,2,2,4,3
A Shneyderman,0,"JFK to Ben Gurion and back. The two worst flights of my life. The return flight was about as close to hell as I think you can get on Earth. To say it was tight is an understatement. I'm 5' 6"" tall and my knees were in the seat in front of me the entire time. This time the plane was a Portuguese company with their own staff. They did not answer the call button. The flight had a stopover in England for refueling which we were not told about. They also did not have any sort of order or pattern which was obvious when it came to food. One side would be served about 15 minutes before the other side. And the food was either scalding hot (I burned my finger tips trying to get the lid off) or it was cold. The return flight was 17 hours long and we got 2 very small meals the entire time. When I say small vegetarian breakfast consisted of 2 cherry tomatoes and 3 cucumber slices some olives and a packet of soy product which tasted so sweet it was unbearable. They had 'muffins' and 'fruit' for a few hours between dinner and lunch. On the way there they did give us slippers that were useful and on the way back we got an inflatable pillow and eye mask. But this meant there were not enough 'real' pillows to go around and a travel pillow on an aisle seat is not very useful. Also towards the end of the flight only one bathroom still had toilet paper. The rest were out of toilet paper paper towel and facial tissue hours before the flight ended.",4/2/2008,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,1
A Mendoza,0,MNL-BKK return Business class. Tickets were not that cheap compared to TG so I question the value of putting up with slow clumsy service old seats and bad food. MNL-BKK leg started well with pre take of drinks and hot towels. Food orders were taken and meals were served properly. Food quality was mediocre at best. BKK-MNL was disappointing. No pre take off drinks or towels. Food orders taken but service was slow while they appeared rushed. Lots of spilling and plates falling on the floor. Food was inedible. For a little more money TG would be a world of difference for the same route.,1/13/2010,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,6
A Siddiqui,0,FRA to DFW on 1/10/14. Wife and children (well behaved and quiet) coming back home. No special meal request. Cabin crew went past them on two occasions once during the beverage service and once during the meal service without stopping to ask if they wanted something to eat or drink. They were not even sleeping. Worse was when my wife called them back the flight attendants acted all surprised that my wife and children actually wanted to eat or drink anything! Yes on a 11 hour flight. Incredible.,1/13/2014,2,2,1,1,1,1

A Simmonds,0,Inefficient unhelpful and rude staff at check-in in Tashkent. Charged an additional 40 Euros for luggage despite being an economy not a basic ticket which according to the official website should allow 20kgs free of charge. A scribbled receipt was issued after persistent requests. First flight from Tashkent to Riga took off and arrived on time. Second flight from Riga to Istanbul was late to depart by 30 minutes. Riga airport was chaotic no information was given regarding the lateness of the plane. The planes were adequate the on board flight attendants polite. Poor value and I would not use this airline again.,7/28/2013,3,3,2,1,3,4

A Sinan,0,Flew BOG-PTY-BOS yesterday in Economy Class and I can tell you if they weren't the only airline from South America to fly non-stop to Boston I would have never taken them. Old and small aircraft for a 6-hour flight bad service no PTV or IFE bad food expensive rude and unhelpful male flight attendants who barely speak English 20 min wait at the Business Class check-in line cramped space in aircraft's. I'm only glad for the Star Alliance miles I hope I earned. I wouldn't recommend them to anybody who has flown European and Asian airlines.

A Mihalicz,0,Newark-Dublin tickets booked 7 months ahead only to be assigned the last 2 seats in the last row of the plane - row 40 E/F. Having to sit with a queue of passengers waiting for the toilet standing in our faces for over 4 hrs of a 6 hr flight. This was intrusive uncomfortable and most upsetting for us. Furthermore we were unable to recline our seats for a bit of comfort seeing that our seats were right up against the bulkhead furthermore a tall passenger sitting in front of my husband's seat had reclined her seat to the maximum with her long legs sticking up over the seat in front. We felt trapped and I was unable to get out of my seat to use the toilet or stretch my back during the whole 6 hr flight. Obviously if we could afford to fly Business class we would but seeing that we can't all it would have taken was a little kindly observant thoughtfulness and consideration.,9/12/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Skidmore,1,Flew four times over the course of a month internally around Argentina (EZE-El Calafate El Calafate-Trelew Trelew-EZE EZE-Iguazu) and was very happy with service. Check in was prompt and staff were friendly and bilingual. Never experienced any delays in fact we were actually moved forward from a 6 hour change at EZE to a flight departing 5 hours sooner for no extra charge. Snacks and drinks served in all flights and despite the 737-7 seats being noticeably more cramped and less comfortable than the -800 I'd certainly recommend.,12/22/2014,4,3,4,1,5,10
A Miller,0,First international flight from MCO to HKG was great. Very smooth. Crew very helpful. Being on a 15+ hr flight hydration is important. All I had to do was take my water bottle to the back and the crew happily refilled it for me multiple times. They even came around with trays of cups with water every so often. Second flight back (HKG to MCO) was a disaster. First flight from HKG to Newark was delayed 2 hours. Not a big deal we still had time to make our connecting flight. However the plane was further delayed by another 1.5 hrs after we were already on it. The crew were extremely rude. After 6 hours of no water my husband asked if we could refill my water bottle same as the first flight but this time they looked at him like he was crazy and said they were about to bring the drink cart around so to just wait for that. By the time we finally touched down in Newark we missed our connecting flight so had to be put on one 4 hours later. Again that flight from Newark to MCO was delayed. Instead of leaving at 9pm as scheduled we took off from the runway at 11pm after waiting 2 hours on the plane. One of the bathrooms was not functioning properly. They made an announcement that they weren't going to fix the bathroom but had to fill out paperwork anyway so we'd be off the ground as soon as paperwork was finished. Next thing we know a guy is coming down the aisle and starts fixing the bathroom. Then we had to wait for him to fix it before we took off. In the meantime they let 5 more people on the flight so they had to play the safety video a second time before we could take off. Thankfully we had no problem getting our luggage. The movie selection available was also decent. Food was okay for the first two meals and the third was disgusting.,3/26/2014,2,2,1,4,2,3
A Skilton,0,Read the review dated 28 April 2014 by Raoul DaSilva this persons experiences echo's mine. I flew BA0016 club world and was most disappointed.

A Smith,1,XIY to CTU on Boeing 737-800 in Economy. Flight delayed one and a half hours due to weather crew did their best to inform and entertain us during this period. After takeoff flight was absolutely the calmest ever- not the slightest hint of turbulence. Friendly crew explained patiently to pax (including why we were on a Shanxi Airlines a/c as they and Hainan have not fully merged at that time yet and the a/c was yet too be repainted).

A Milossavlevich,0,BEG-WAW and WAW-TBS. E170 on first leg. Rudimentary service consisting only of a glass of water and a choco- waffle. The only choices you had was between still and sparkling water. Still ok for such a short flight. Legroom was superb like on an A330. In-flight magazine of very poor quality. Second leg on E190. It was a more comfortable plane but exactly the same service on a 4-hours long flight. Got offered a pillow and a blanket for the night flight what was a nice surprise. Plane was full. There were some unruly Polish passengers on-board. All in all I would fly LOT only if their price is the same or slightly above the low-costs on the same route.,11/20/2014,3,3,1,1,2,3
A Smith,1,ADL-SIN-DME / LHR-SIN-ADL. Four legs with SQ for this trip to Europe. Seems that catering has improved since my last trip in April.

A Smith,0,"By far one of the worst flights I've had. Flew PVG-LHR on one of the A340-600 in 60K (G-VWEB). I'm 5"" 8' so not the largest person in the world and yet my knees were being poked the entire flight by the pocket from the seat in front of me. Padding on the seat was pretty much non-existent resulting in a rather numb behind after a short time into the flight. Also it's worth noting that it seems seats in A and K mostly have something under them for the in-flight entertainment system. This meant I had even less space to stretch if needed due to that being under the seat in front of me. The headrest was incapable of keeping the position of the wings that are on it collapsing the second you put your head against it. If the person in the seat in front puts their seat back it makes the experience even more claustrophobic - not to mention making it hard to use the screen for the in-flight entertainment. Not that that matters as the screen quality is so bad you won't want to use it anyway. Then there is the food - it's tasteless overcooked and there's not a lot of quantity to it. At least they came around at reasonable times with it and offered drinks fairly often during the flight. Also the lack of any form of power is annoying not even a USB port for plugging a phone/tablet into.",4/24/2014,2,1,1,1,2,1
A Smith,1,6 of us flew to Alicante Airport from Leeds Bradford early on 26th October 2013. Check in was great the woman who checked us in said that there weren't any rows of 3 together so asked if we would like to have the extra leg room seats which were on buy one get one free! We paid Â£28 altogether for the 6 seats which was worth it! We were also told we could check in out hand luggage free of charge if we wanted to but we decided not to as we hadn't brought any other bag to carry through the airport. Boarding was quick and easy. The cabin crew couldn't do enough assisting with putting baggage into the overhead compartments before you even had a chance to ask! The service of drinks and snacks was quick and easy. Upon landing the cabin crew again assisted with taking baggage from the overhead lockers as quick as possible and we were off the flight within minutes. Overall an excellent flight and a great start to our holiday. We will definitely be flying with jet2 again.,11/1/2013,5,5,5,NaN,5,10
A Smith,0,Flew from Victoria BC Canada to Cancun and flew back two weeks later. Friendly service. On time Plenty of luggage allowance. Food minimal and had to be paid for except a tiny snack. Drinks - two soft drinks free - 6 hr flight! Main complaint - long flight - two films only. (So 3 hrs no entertainment). Then amazingly same films on the way back. Flight was not cheap. Boasted of satellite TV did not work in either direction and I suspect it never does. Disappointed to say the least.,11/19/2012,2,3,1,1,4,4
A Smith,0,PEK-HKG. This was a very average airline and I would not go out of my way to fly them again. The seating felt very cramped the flight attendants seemed to lack that high level of customer service but again nothing that was hard to deal with. Not sure why an airline like this gets 4 stars where other airlines I've flown on international legs (Delta United etc) only get 3 stars. This didn't feel any better. If you get the right price though don't hesitate to fly with them.,9/16/2012,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,5
A Smithee,1,LAX-SFO: Simple flight made easier by a relaxed crew. Great entertainment system blankets and pillows and a nice flow of a small meal and after-meal snack plus plenty to drink.

A Sneddon,0,My Kathmandu-Dubai flight was originally booked for 18.45. This was changed about a week before departure to 21.55. The night before this was changed again to 14.35. On arrival at the airport there were plenty of passengers all ready to check in for the 14.35. No FD staff were present and we heard the flight was delayed until 18.45. At 3 the gate finally opened and we were told there never was a 14.35 flight and our travel agents must have made a mistake - even though the departure time on our boarding passes was 14.35! Flight eventually took off an hour late. In the 7 hours wait no-one from FD offered an apology an explanation or even a cup of tea. Cabin crew refused to give us complimentary food. I will not use this airline again.,11/22/2012,2,2,0,0,1,NaN
A Snelling,1,EWR-ZHR and ZHR-ORD in Economy. Clean new planes with great IFE. Food out of EWR was average but the food out of ZHR was outstanding. FA's were friendly and restrooms were clean. I think it has been over 20 years since I have had real silverware in Economy but Swiss provided it on both flights. Wine cheese and chocolate were great. I fly to Europe several times per year and this is probably the best Economy class experience I have had in many years.,4/18/2013,4,4,4,5,4,9
A Milossavlyevich,1,NYC-SVO-KBP on A330-300 and A321. Prior to the flight newspapers were distributed. We were then stuck in a jam while taxiing prior to take-off. Service onboard was plain and overall very correct. I have low interest in IFE though the little I tried seemed quite correct. We were served dinner and breakfast the former with wine. We arrived on time. The transfer went smoothly and the second leg was as pleasant as the other. The fare was 30-40% cheaper than on other airlines doing the route. Great value for money and solid level of quality.,11/24/2011,5,4,4,4,4,7
A Snyder,0,Worst airline I have ever flown. We are frequent flyers and this was a trip from hell. We will never fly Delta again. We were traveling from LAX to Dublin with a change of planes in N.Y. We sat in the plane on the ground for 2 hours at L.A.X. because of mechanical problems. Because of this we missed our connection to Dublin so had to spend the night in N.Y. From N.Y. They flew us to Atlanta the next day. Again there was airplane problems. We waited for two hours at the airport for them to find a plane that worked. It took us two days to get to Dublin. On the way home we flew from Dublin to N.Y. again sat on ground for 2 hours and 15 minutes on the Tarmac. Once we arrived back at LAX waited another hour in baggage claim only to find that our one bag was put on another flight.,5/31/2015,2,3,3,3,4,NaN

Despite leaving at ungodly hours 3.30am in my case this is probably one of my favourite low cost carriers and in my opinion better than some full service airlines that fly from the middle east to India.

Since leaving so early in the morning lights are switched off early overall happy with the service Air Arabia provides.,7/7/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,10
A Soriano,0,Our flight was delayed over an hour going to Kuala Lumpur and over 40 hours going back to Manila! Cebu Pacific didn't even bother to book us for an overnight stay at a hotel. We also had to demand for every meal voucher that we were provided. In the plane they ran out of hot meals (instant cup noodles) and chips. Prior seat selections we had paid for were not honoured either. To top it all when we got back to Manila our luggage was missing!,5/22/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Spicer,1,Return flight from Manchester to Pisa and can't speak highly enough of the airline. From online booking through to on time departures was all excellent. On our return flight last Thursday when about 30 mins from Manchester there was a problem with cabin decompression and the oxygen masks were deployed. The cabin crew remained professional and this kept passengers calm with no panic. We descended to 8000ft at which point the pilot came on apologizing for causing concern and thanking passengers for remaining calm. We landed shortly afterwards at Manchester albeit with a fire engine escort. All the crew including the pilots saw us off the aircraft and there were plenty of Jet2 reps at the carousel. Any airline can deliver in normal circumstances but we saw first hand how they coped when things go wrong and that's when you really do want them to deliver.,5/14/2013,5,4,4,NaN,5,10
A Mitchell,0,YYZ-LAS return. I have been a loyal AC customer and Super Elite. Air Canada Rouge is a step back in customer service and flight comfort. The seats are cramped and uncomfortable. A four hour flight and one cup of cold tea regular flights on AC the service is night and day. I will not fly Rouge again the price of a ticket is not a bargain. Extremely disappointing.,12/1/2014,1,1,1,1,1,1

A Starr,1,Sydney - Taipei - Vienna in Business. Stopped overnight at Sunmoon Lake Taiwan to catch connected Vienna service. Flew CI last year and the service is still good. Qantas lounge in Sydney excellent CI lounge in Taipei ok limited drinks and food. On board service good but they really need to review serving breakfast three hours before arrival in Taipei when the flight arrives at 4.10 am. This could have been done 1.5 hours prior. Would fly again if they keep the fares low and continue to offer the better airbus business class seats on the route that I wish to fly.,1/26/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
A Molenberghs,0,Ethiopian Airlines was the worst travel experience I have ever had. Dubai-Johannesburg and back via Addis Ababa for the World Cup. The outbound flight was late missed our connection so had to stay overnight in Addis. Missed the first day of World Cup opening ceremony and game. On the way home no luggage when we arrived in Dubai. Two pieces turned up after a few days one was declared lost after 40 days. The customer service is terrible the flights are always late and the Business Class we travelled was the worst business class I have ever flown with.,8/28/2010,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Stefan,0,My flight from Toronto to a conference in Chicago was cancelled with no reason provided 12 hours prior to the flight. The only option Porter offered was to re-book 2 hours after the original departure time. If I had cancelled to rebook on a different airline (at a significantly increased cost given the short notice) I would have received only a flight credit not a full refund which is unbelievably bad customer treatment. I was forced to take the later flight and I missed the two sessions at the conference that were the primary reason for my attendance. I am 6 feet two hundred pounds. These planes do not accommodate above average sized people period.,9/17/2014,3,1,3,1,3,2
A Moore,0,Manchester to Kuala Lumpur via Abu Dhabi on New Year's Eve. On boarding dispute over 2 people sitting in wrong seats woman refused to move stewardess did not know how to handle it eventually after unsuccessfully pleading with her to move she told the couple whose seats they were that she would find them somewhere else to sit but they would be apart naturally they refused! Meanwhile nobody else could get past to get to their seats. Service on board was extremely slow we had the wrong menu card. Even though the Cabin Crew were wearing 'Happy new year' hats when we boarded there was only a passing reference to it being 2014 as we passed over Romania. Abu Dhabi airport experience was an awful chaotic shambles. Multiple flights arrived simultaneously and they clearly could not cope with the thousands of passengers in transit. Nobody knew what they were queuing for or even if they were in the right terminal. Airport staff were taking no notice of those who were trying to tell them they would miss their connection if they stayed in the queue luckily we had a 3 hour wait so we were not worried just bemused at the chaos. Security control was a joke only 6 manned and shouting to us to 'leave everything in your bags'. Not looking forward to going back through on the way home. Food on board was nothing special entertainment not brilliant headphones didn't work. Overall not a good experience would not use Etihad again travelled to KL with Emirates last time and there is no comparison. Must say however that landings were excellent hardly a bump.,1/8/2014,3,2,1,1,1,1
A Stem,0,This airline does not measure up to other 3 star airlines in terms of service. I just flew 3 legs (2 economy and 1 business). The staff attitude is basically indifference to passengers. Two of my legs were delayed 1 hour plus yet they did not announce the delay until after the departure time. For one there was nobody at the gate to answer any questions (DMM to DXB). Business class service on board decent food was average. Things like making sure people's cell phones are turned off that people stay in their seats at takeoff and landing are virtually ignored by the cabin crew from what I could tell.,5/23/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,3
A Moresco,0,This is one of the worst customer care I have seen I booked my a flight for my children (12 and 9) as junior travelers because SWA had told me they would allow my sister to pick them up at the gate and they do not need someone there through out the flight. Flight delayed an hour and did not allow my sister to the gate. SWA personnel told her they would bring back the kids. However when my sister saw the woman (without the kids) her answer was they did not pay the fee. SWA left them to sort it out on their own at 2am at Boston airport!,7/3/2013,2,0,0,NaN,1,NaN
A Steward,0,Was flying from Flint to Tulsa through Chicago on American Eagle. Arrived well within the check in window but the airport ticket agents were short staffed the guy who was supposed to be at the American Eagle desk was servicing United Airlines. He informed me he could help me when he was done which was 30 min after my plane took off. He blamed me for being to the counter late and when processing my new flight changed my final destination to Tuscon instead of Tulsa. Luckily I caught it before being stranded in Chicago and my bags in Tuscon. There were no additional flights that day so its back home and try again tomorrow. I will give Flint a second try but not American Eagle.,7/15/2014,0,0,0,0,1,NaN
A Morris,1,After reading all of the reviews warning us of delays and cancelled flights we opted to fly Jetstar Pacific from HCM to DaNang fully aware of the ramifications for our actions. The price was too good to resist and we couldn't see the point of paying triple that with Vietnam Airlines. Check in was a slight issue with flights being cancelled left right and centre. The poor staff did their best to deal with an array of angry and difficult customers - but what do you expect for the money you paid? Our flight was delayed 10 hours but staff were lovely and moved us to an earlier flight so we only had to wait 5 hours. In saying this we noticed all of the Vietnam Airlines flights were delayed as well due to weather or late aircraft's. I was happy we hadn't paid an excessive amount to still be sitting around at the airport. If you want to fly out of HCM I would recommend Jetstar for their excellent prices. However next time I would opt to get the bus and avoid delays altogether!,5/11/2014,4,3,0,0,4,5
A Storey,1,"What a difference a new plane can make. New seat is comfortable and well designed, sat in a reverse facing seat but did not feel out of place. Crew very friendly.

A Moskona,0,MIA-LIS: old-ish A330. Video barely worked and audio was broken. Food quality was poor and to our surprise it was even worse on the return leg (LIS-MIA) where we were served an aluminium foil container with parboiled rice and a few cubes of chicken a barely-edible fish spread and a totally unpalatable desert. LIS- MIA: newer A330. Better entertainment system except that audio was broken (again) and cheap earphones just didn't work. Cabin service was minimal. Meal was quickly cleared and crew disappeared for the rest of the 10 hour flight only to re-emerge to serve a snack. If you were thirsty you could go to the back where a flight attendant with an attitude poured you half a cup of water.,1/15/2013,2,0,1,1,2,3
A Storey,1,HNL to AKL. Very clean A330 with neat mood lighting throughout whole cabin. Nice food but no choice. Free drinks and snacks provided at the back during the flight. Crew we're very friendly. Movies not the latest but plenty to watch. Would fly again.,12/12/2013,5,4,3,4,5,8

A Storey,1,LAX-KUL-HKT round trip. B777 from LAX was great service food and AVOD. Seats are angle flat and first generation.

A Muller,0,"Flew from LGW-BFS. First of all our cabin baggage was just 2 centimetres too long and because of that wanted to charge us 45 pounds to put the bag in the hold. Very rude about it. Gate agent who thought she had a little bit of power. So they have us a rubbish bag out of the bin to put our stuff in. By the way this bag has flown in the easyJet cabin before without a problem. When we boarded the plane we told a cabin crew member and rudely said to us ""You must have got away with it before but you didn't this time."" We even saw bigger bags than our one going in the overhead lockers! We told a crew member and he said ""Well I'm not checking the bag sizes."" No customer courtesy! Next my grandmother is disabled and when we boarded the plane since one of our family members booked the flight didn't choose the seats they gave us a window and a middle seat. My grandmother is claustrophobic and has arthritis. We asked if she could have an aisle seat and said there was nothing that could be done and that she would have to take that seat. Not one bit of sympathy! The man who had the aisle seat was kind enough to let her sit on the aisle and he sat at the window! No courtesy from the staff! No help! Outrageously not allowing our bag on because of the wheel being 2 centimetres too long when bigger bags we saw were allowed on!",8/13/2014,3,3,3,NaN,2,4
A Storey,1,ORD-AUH-JFK via Amman. A340 on the long haul legs and A319 for the short ones. On all flights the crew were great lots of smiles checking to make sure everything was OK and ready to help. Food and drinks were good although wines are limited selections. Inflight entertainment was enough to kill the hours. Seats in A340 not lie flat but very comfortable. They start the 787 service to the US in June. lounge in new terminal at Amman was an oasis of calm and quiet.,2/14/2014,5,5,4,4,5,9
A Subrahmanyam,0,TLV-LAX B777. Seat back when not reclined is too stiff and strains neck muscles. Just two meal services both very light. Very poor snack selections. IFE is laughable fuzzy video on fixed loop with obscure movies. That El Al cannot invest in state of the art IFE for such long flights is shameful. Flight attendants pretty curt and careless (delivered my special meal to the wrong seat and didn't check or apologize).

A Murray,1,LTN-EWR Return. We just flew this airline for the first time and can strongly recommend it. We caught a train (frequent service) to Luton Parkway from central London and were transferred to the Silverjet terminal by complimentary taxi. All relatively straightforward. Check in was the best I have ever experienced- staff take your passport and whilst you sit in the lounge enjoying breakfast they complete the check in procedure. Very stress free. Our outgoing flight was an hour late in departing due to adverse weather conditions but passengers were kept updated and the pilot himself came into the lounge to introduce himself and explain what was happening. This was representative of the whole experience - staff friendly (they ask onboard how you wish to be addressed) and courteous but informal which is a very pleasant departure from other airlines I have been on. Food was better on the outbound leg and the departure lounge in New York is a little small but overall this was one of the best airline experiences I have ever had and despite the inconvenience of leaving from Luton will certainly be using them again. Re previous comments about passenger numbers - our flights were both running at about 80% full - I only hope that this continues to improve as this airline deserves to succeed.,3/17/2008,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Sutherland,0,LHR-BKK via Muscat 15th/16th Dec BKK-LHR via Muscat 27th Dec. Outbound flight was tolerable although service has declined to perfunctory. What happened to the meals? Suvarnabhumi deplaning delayed first by 30 mins as pilot appeared to take wrong exit from main runway. Chaotic scenes as people started unloading luggage lockers while still on apron. No control from crew. 27th flights back were appalling. Muscat transfer was 1hr. Qatar can manage at 45mins. Not Oman. Deplaning delayed for 25 minutes as coaches were found. Chaos ensued with huge tail back at security. Being shouted at for being late by airport staff for Oman's inefficiency is not on. Plane for Muscat Heathrow leg was both shockingly filthy and decrepit. Toilets were disgusting tray tables stained and smothered in food debris. Whole plane smelt. This was a real shock to us we've used Oman regularly for over 5 yrs but these flights mean we're looking elsewhere. With the awful food offering dirty planes and being treated like cattle Oman seems to pitching to be the Gulf version of Ryannair.,12/29/2013,1,1,1,1,4,NaN

Clean and spotless aircraft's legroom a bit limited though. Cabin crew very efficient and lot of smiles. Masala tea bought on board was tasty. Bus rides between gates and aircraft.

Flight attendants did their job efficiently one of them on the DXB-BOM leg was cheerful and interacted very well with the passengers. Food was awful on the DXB-BOM flight and above average on others.

I am a regular traveller on this route probably flying to and from Zahedan from tehran about 12 times a year - an expert in terms of seating on these old A300 Fokker 100 and B727 aircraft. Always ask for seat by the exit door. You will otherwise experience severe cases of cramp and discomfort after each flight. The food on these flights normally comprises a cold platter two filled rolls a chocolate biscuit and an orange drink!

This may explain why I am puzzled by all the negative comments. I flew Kona-Maui Maui-Molokai and Molokai-Honolulu this summer and all three flights were perfect flight experiences and I had more than 45 pounds of luggage with me. Indeed you are weighed at check-in like in pre-WWI days (remember that Cessnas are very small propeller planes with serious weight limitations not large jets) but this is done discreetly. I flew on what seemed to be brand new aircraft. The seating arrangements also are clearly designed for center of gravity optimisation. Good side is that you always get a window and aisle seat (1+1 seating) and since you don't fly very high the views of Hawaii from above are magnificent. And for airline geeks such as myself you see and hear what's going on in the cockpit which is interesting.",9/17/2014,4,4,0,0,4,9
A Newton,0,LHR-AUH-BKK-AUH-LHR. I'm realistic about what to expect in Economy I'm a budget student traveller after all but the service was so indifferent on all legs of the journey. All flights were delayed by at least 2 hours luckily they all had a large amount of connecting passengers so the following flights were held for us. Food was terrible I've had a lot better in economy on Qatar and Emirates. Cabin crew were ok nothing more nothing less no one smiled no one cared never really experienced such indifferent service from crew on any airline.

Never buy food on a plane anyway so that wasn't too much of a problem. Coming back we found the journey quite itchy and upon arrival at Manchester found ourselves covered in bites.

A George,0,London-Beirut return. Day before travel received a call saying that the outbound flight had been cancelled. Was re-booked on a later flight thereby causing us to lose our first evening in Beirut. But at least we were upgraded to Business Class. 48 hours before the return flight I received an email from BMI saying the Beirut-London flight had been cancelled. At this time I was in northern Iraq on a mobile phone. It was very difficult dealing with a call centre in - I think - India. Initially they insisted that it had not been confirmed that the flight had been cancelled - despite the earlier email! At length they re-booked us on an earlier flight. As a result we lost a day in Beirut. On checking in for the earlier flight I asked for an upgrade by way of compensation. This was refused. The check-in girl claimed (falsely I believe) that upgrades could only be done from London! This was the first time I'd used this airline - and it will be the last time. It seems to cancel its flights rather routinely giving passengers almost no time to make alternative arrangements.

We were told by the personnel at the gate that our flight was being delayed approximately 4 hrs due to a plane in New York with mechanical problems. Simultaneously we began receiving emails from the jetblue website telling us the delayed flight would depart at an earlier time. The Gate personnel had no knowledge of this. Bottom line is: customers pay hefty fares for some flights particularly on weekends and we do expect these planes to leave on time.

But the thing that really amazes me is the unfriendliness of the cabin crew. Are they trained to be stiff and impolite? What would a smile and a friendly positive attitude towards the customers cost? Now the basic feeling on the flights has been that the customers are only irritating nuisances.,7/11/2013,3,3,1,1,1,2
A Tello,1,MIA-PTY-LIM return. As a Onepass Gold Elite I was upgraded on all 4 segments - Check in and cabin crew friendly. Meals in business class are not impressive.

You could sleep comfortably (it wasn't a lie flat since it was on a A330) and the other positions were very comfortable. The IFE was up to date and entertaining. Everything was on time and arrival at Singapore was perfect. I arrived at T2 and it was empty with barely anyone else there.

A Thomas,1,Although I managed to check-in online with Lufthansa via Avianca given an earlier connecting La Paz to Bogota flight the latter did not let me print boarding passes told to report to the check-in counter. Thus I had to join 30-40 person long check-in queues at 2 am taking an hour to clear. There was a long layover of 14 hours in Bogota so connections via Star Alliance are not convenient. The seat assigned for the 11-hour Lufthansa LH 543 flight BOG-FRA on Sunday 24 August was totally different from one I selected online - 24D versus 55K and at odds with what I had requested on booking months earlier and as stated permanently on my Silver frequent flyer record. I asked for the seat to be changed but was told that this could not be done on the Avianca system only in La Paz by Lufthansa despite both airlines being part of Star Alliance. At Bogota airport I was informed initially by Lufthansa staff that this was due to overbooking and 'nothing' could be done. They also tried to put the blame on me for not informing them earlier or checking-in earlier. I had done my online check-in 24 hours ahead of Avianca flight which was about 38 hours ahead of the Lufthansa one - well before most others would have checked-in and so should have got my selected seat. I was then told of a 'special offer' of a business class upgrade of USD600 - another profit-maximising effort instead of service-recovery of a complimentary upgrade or even a USD100 one which I might have accepted in desperation. The seat was finally changed grudgingly - without apology or even a smile - at the gate to 55G at a part of plane and side I did not like at all.,8/28/2014,3,2,3,3,4,2
A O'Flynn,1,I flew SYD to AKL on a 777-200U after flying from Saigon and it was a real pleasure to fly. The cabin was new and very comfortable. The IFE was great with a very responsive touch screen that was more like a tablet than the usual unresponsive screens. The seat was very good with plenty of space - I am a large man and usually my knees touch the back of the seat but not on this plane. I didn't try the food as I was not feeling that well but the crew have a relaxed but competent manner.,2/24/2015,4,4,4,5,4,10
A Ohno,0,HKG-HND paid full price for economy ticket yet got an awful seat in a separate partitioned area of 2 rows right behind business class. About 5 or 6 babies in the vicinity all crying at various intervals. Furthermore seat was incredibly uncomfortable - not the regular seats but the seat cushion is shorter and dips down in the center putting pressure on thighs. When I asked to change seats FA just brushed me off even though there were a couple empty seats elsewhere. The IFE? Tiny low res screen audio was on/off due to ageing headphone input jack.,3/5/2014,1,1,2,1,1,1
A Thompson,0,Checked in for my flight at Rome International Airport to Auckland New Zealand via Hong Kong. Queued to board when a Cathay Pacific hostess said there was a delay to go have lunch then return at 1pm. I returned at 1pm. My flight was still not boarding and no staff present. Waited a further 2 hours before any staff were present to answer questions. Told the flight had been delayed until 9am the next morning to go to the Hilton hotel and those with connecting flights will receive information once there. No explanation for the delay. In the morning we were told that connecting flights would be arranged once we landed at Hong Kong. No boarding gate was given security would not let us through as our boarding passes were for the day before Cathay Pacific staff failed to inform them we were coming. Once at the gate we were told of a further delay until 4pm. Told there were no seats on that days flight to Hong Kong. I was informed my connecting flight from Hong Kong to Auckland would be rescheduled and would be available when I landed. This did not happen. Staff at Hong Kong put me on a later flight. I am extremely annoyed at how the situation was handled. I will never fly Cathay Pacific again.,9/2/2013,1,1,1,3,1,1
A O'Neill,0,My family traveled to Ft Lauderdale in February. The trip down was fine. The trip back very upsetting primarily due to extremely rude employees. We switched seats online prior to our return flight to the row behind the exit. It was clear we were traveling with an infant and car seat. We were seated at the beginning of the flight in the row behind the exit. We sat there with the employees passing by us for over 2.5 hours. In the last 30-45 minutes an attendant came up and said 'we have a problem' and she ordered us to move because we apparently couldn't be seated with a car seat behind the exit row. We questioned this order because there was only 30-45 minutes left on the flight. So we moved without any help. We accept the baggage limitations and paid for our suitcases. We accept it's a discount airline. We do not accept despicable treatment of paying customers.,4/7/2014,1,1,1,1,1,1
A Bennet,0,29 Sep 2014 AY82. Eventually flew on 30th AY5004. 30 Sep 2014 AY715. I travel for work and this was without a doubt the worst experience I have had. Don't fly with them especially for business or if you actually want to reach your destination. Old planes. Numerous delays and rescheduled flights. Non existent customer service at every stop and on top of that they lost my luggage.,1/23/2015,1,1,1,1,1,NaN
A Thomson,1,We flew from Toronto to Orlando and had a terrific flight! We paid the additional $15 for premium and had seat selection at the front of the plane priority boarding and extra luggage weight up to 68lbs. Was definitely worth it! Flights were on time flight attendants were very friendly and even the airplane food was decent. Highly recommend Sunwing it was a great experience.,4/23/2014,5,4,4,2,5,8
A Orzechowski,1,I flew from Toronto (YYZ) to Venice (VCE) on the 767-300ER. Rouge is simple but still provided a pleasant flight. Leg room not bad at all. Flight attendants were all female and young. Hot meal served but alcohol costs money. No video screens but who cares when you have a good-looking crew to look at.,8/18/2014,4,4,3,2,5,9
A Tindell,1,Pasco to Las Vegas 3x to Mesa 2x and Los Angeles 2x. You don't fly Allegiant if you expect comfortable seats warm service or even being on time. It's a relatively inexpensive ride that's all. Bring your own drinks and food. Get to the airport a couple hours before the flight. Don't show up with overweight bags. Expect flight delays. Expect skeletal staff that's worked to the bone doing multiple tasks. Don't fly Allegiant if it's a really significant trip like attending a wedding or going to Hawaii. Don't get same-day-as-flight show tickets in Vegas. If you play defence like that and expect nothing more than bare minimum no frills travel then Allegiant isn't a bad way to fly. The longest delay I ever had was a 3 hour delay leaving Pasco for Vegas. It killed that evening there but we hadn't booked and shows that evening either. Just flew to Los Angeles this past weekend. Short acceptable delay going down. Return flight an hour delay because they initially didn't have a flight crew. That was a new one. But they flew faster and we arrived only 45 min late which is essentially on-time for Allegiant.,8/5/2013,3,4,0,0,4,7
A Owaida,1,TLV-MAD-TLV Dec 6-9. On the outbound I was offered an upgrade to business for $150 which I gladly accepted. Even though it was a small A319 it had the big reclining business class seats and the service was wonderful. Luggage took less than 5 minutes to arrive on the belt. On the return no upgrade this time but I was lucky to get the emergency exit seat and had plenty of room the flight was only 40% full which helps. Would gladly fly them again.,12/13/2012,5,4,4,0,5,10
A Tremewan,1,SYD-HNL-SYD. Seated at the back of the plane. Plane was full but there was enough space. Check in was efficient and flights on time both ways. IFE was the only let down. Very limited range of movies and even though we flew over in Oct and back in Nov we had Nov choices both ways so 20 hrs with only 2 movies I wanted to see out of the limited selection. We didn't buy food but took our own on the plane and this was no problem. Checking in baggage is not inexpensive but if you do it at time of booking it is not too bad. If you follow the rules about booking/ flying with a LCC they are definitely worth looking into.,11/22/2012,5,4,0,2,5,8
A Gibbons,0,Truly awful customer service. Got a return trip from Manchester to Prague. Outbound flight delayed by an hour due to an aircraft fault - not so bad as it was a Thursday early evening flight so didn't impact too much on the trip. Cabin crew were helpful and friendly. Return leg on Sunday evening due to depart at 20.05 was delayed by 5 hours and we were only told about this half an hour after we got to the airport. They knew about it the previous day because it was caused by an aircraft going completely out of service in Gran Canaria. So standards of aircraft maintenance are obviously not the greatest! In total we had to spend 7 hours in Prague airport and all we got was a 255 Kc voucher each worth about Â£7. The airport restaurants are expensive so this didn't go very far. Eventually got home at 3am when we both had to go to work the next day. The very least they could have done is text or emailed us when they knew they'd be an aircraft down 24 hours before the flight and we could have spent more time in Prague. I got a text at 20.08 three minutes after the flight was due to take off. Brilliant. Never flying with this lot again.,7/15/2012,3,3,0,NaN,1,2
A Pad,1,Travelled from Clark Pampanga to Bangkok. Flight left and arrived on time. Major downside - passengers were made to walk from the terminal gate to the plane. On my return flight however a shuttle was provided for passengers. Also not enough legroom. Overall the price is worth the service though.,3/25/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,7
A Tsui,0,19 Feb 2014 EK405 MEL-SIN. 23 Feb 2014 EK404 SIN-MEL. Fly frequently but this was the first experience with Emirates. The plane itself was great with good food and entertainment especially with the big screen. Ground crew service at Singapore Airport was a nightmare. System problem with seat allocation which our pre-booked seats were being occupied. Staff were being rude to customers at check in counters. Customers do not come back with this kind of service level.,3/12/2014,1,4,5,5,1,2
A Pagan,1,IST-JIB with return. Both sectors brand new A321 with very good IFE. Food always above standards and plenty of soft drinks (no spirits on these flights). Cabin crew very attentive. The outbound leg arrived 30 minutes early. However the return had a delay of 30 minutes and I had a connection flight to catch (1h 30 min). This is the biggest issue with THY. Ground handling in IST. Although they were informed they did nothing. Long bus ride and then the chaotic security control of IST airport. The only reason that I didn't miss the next flight was a 20 minute delay. As far as it goes for value for money.,3/28/2014,3,4,5,5,4,8
A Gibson,0,Flew to Corfu August 5. Pleasant and helpful crew. Large section of ceiling trim came lose after very heavy landing. 45 minute delay appx. The return on August 19 was a nightmare. Nine hour delay. Little information from the airline and all of it conflicting including the reason given by the captain once airborne. No apology of course. After some hours at the airport most passengers bussed off like livestock to a dismal meal in a barn of a dining hall at a local resort hotel. Back at the airport to be greeted by further delay they were given pittance tokens for 'dead' sandwich rolls and a soft drink. Once it was obvious the delay was going to be prolonged we cleared off back into town for a proper meal and refreshments at our own expense. Our tour operator stepped in where the airline failed and kept us in touch with developments while we were away from the airport.,10/2/2013,1,2,0,0,4,NaN
A Tungsiri,0,AMS-ARN. Check-in went smoothly and the check in agent was polite helpful and friendly. Big plus for the Crown Lounge. The food was nice although there were only two things to choose from. Plenty of drinks though. I know it was a 2-hour flight so I didn't expect much but the service onboard was so so. Nothing special. I got my drinks and my meal nothing more. And please if you only serve cava on short haul flights then don't call it champagne please. I had some issues when I booked my flight. KLM promised to get back to me but they never did. Although I really enjoyed the lounge at AMS but because of issues during booking process the customer service the service onboard in the class I was traveling in I will try to avoid KLM in the future.,2/20/2014,2,3,2,0,2,3
A Palomo,1,BHX to Munich via Frankfurt and Munich to Birmingham inbound. Could not fault the flights I had with them. Service was very good and cabin crew attentive. Travelled with two friends for the Oktoberfest who were both 6ft 6in and I am below 6 ft. Both of my tall friends had no complaints with the legroom. Baggage arrived on time. All in all flights had been hassle-free. Only downside is lack of entertainment but for a short flight it was barely noticeable. Will definitely fly with them again.,10/12/2014,4,5,3,2,5,8
A Turner,0,LHR-IST return. As a frequent business class passenger who has already tried British Airways Lufthansa KLM Etihad Emirates I can only say that this was definitely the worst of them all. Old and run-down seats with parts of the seat torn down and dirty. First part of the trip with newer 777 and angled lie flat but return a recliner like on a premium economy. Serving of the food and the quality more like an economy class and nothing like a business class. Flight attendants OK except one lady on the return who was rude.,4/10/2015,2,2,2,2,2,3
A Panguin,0,Hanoi to Singapore. Departure delayed. Economy was full so some were upgraded to business. Food was passable IFE consisted of documentaries. The only English language newspaper was Vietnam news. The seat had the old-fashion DC-out power socket but the steward said that there was no power at the seat. I had flown VN a few years ago and it was fine. I would say a notch down from SQ. This time I would say it is several notches down.,4/21/2012,3,4,3,0,4,4
A Gill,1,Johannesburg to Cape Town on an early departure (0605). The seats are comfortable and Breakfast was tasty. The crew were professional and friendly. Arrived on time and no problems experienced.,4/22/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Ucfaaay,1,I had a return flight London Stansted to Athens during February half term with Ryanair. I paid exactly as I expected as I did what Ryanair asks - checked in online and print boarding passes at home. The flight out was very busy and we were told at the gate that our cabin baggage would not be allowed in the cabin. However taking a small bag on board was not an issue so we could take books etc onto the aeroplane. The flight left STN around 20 minutes late which happens so arrived slightly late. However the return flight landed early. The cabin has enough space for me at 6 foot tall and despite being a four hour flight it was fine. I can't knock Ryanair as the return trip was under Â£100 including all the fees. Bargain.,2/24/2015,5,3,0,NaN,0,9
A Paraskeva,1,4th Time flying with Thomson. Flew to Bodrum this time TOM266 outbound and TOM757 inbound. Both 757's each way outbound we had their oldest aircraft they have in their fleet G-BYAT was so nice to fly on her considering she's soon to go out of service! Inbound we had a newer 757 in better condition G-OOBN. Legroom on their aircraft's is acceptable and chair comfort is really good. Crew on the outbound were miserable I have to admit bar one who was pleasant. Inbound crew were fantastic and served with a smile. On the inbound flight we hit some bad turbulence however the captain calmed everyone down by giving us frequent updates.,10/28/2014,5,5,5,0,3,8
A Bent,1,Travelled FCO-AMS then on to MAN and they were excellent. Punctual flights friendly and good humoured staff comfortable flights and a more substantial snack offer than other European short haul airlines. I was very happy with this flight.,6/25/2014,4,5,5,0,5,10
A Gilmore,1,Belfast-Rhodes-Belfast. Clean Airbus A320. Both flights on time friendly staff but the 'meal' they served consisted of a dry bread roll with one small thin slice of ham which was dry. You were not allowed any drinks after the first round with your meal unless it was water.,8/22/2012,4,4,1,0,4,7
A Bernier,0,I traveled several times with them and each time has been a nightmare. Flights being delayed for 4 to 5 hours is common. Last time I flew out of Kuwait the lady at check-in told me: Sorry Sir but the flight is delayed. 2.5 hrs on a 90 minute flight. Of course I was not offered any voucher not even for a drink of water! The worst was my recent flight to Morocco from Abu Dhabi. The flight scheduled to leave at 2 am finally left at 7 am. Not a single announcement was made to inform passengers or to guide them to some desk to get assistance or a voucher. Up to 7 am the airline's website kept listing the departure on time at 2 am. The company was not to blame with the delay the airport was experiencing a failure of the lighting system on the runways. The Etihad service desks were swamped with stranded passengers needing to be rebooked. It was madness to try to get to the desks. Etihad staff was trying their best not to been seen. No attempt was made to bring order to chaos. Things did not get any better once I finally arrived in Morocco. Being so late I had missed my connection. No help from Etihad no one in the airport to guide passengers and assist them.,4/3/2014,1,2,2,3,1,1
A Usmani,1,I traveled JFK-LHR-KWI (6/19/2012) and KWI-JFK (6/24/2012) and was pleased with the service. I saw a lot of negative reviews online after buying my tickets. I was fearful after reading those reviews. The planes/food/crew were nice. I was amazed at the friendliness of the crew. They were very helpful and provided everything I asked for and followed through. The TV screens did not function on the departing flight as was mentioned in some reviews but I was not bothered by it since I do not watch TV on flights and would rather just sleep.,6/25/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
A Parkin,1,I'm a regular 'commuter' on the MAN-LHR-MAN route and warmly welcomed the introduction of 'Little Red' a while back as a worthy competitor to the BA monopoly (following the absorption of bmi). I've used this route quite a few times since in both directions and have always been pretty impressed with what was on offer. On the most recent occasion and through necessity my return booking was made less than 24h. before departure but still only cost some Â£98 return - when BA was quoting something along the lines of Â£300! There's really no differentiation in service and I've always found the staff - both in the terminals and on-board - to be friendly accommodating and pro-active. It's a real pity that rumours and speculation regarding the future of this operation continue to circulate which no doubt must impact upon forward bookings. Definitely worth giving a go - and especially now that T2 at Heathrow is the new 'home' - a much-improved arrival/departure experience!,10/5/2014,5,4,4,1,4,10
A Berry,1,Flew MAN to YVR in May 14 had flown same route in May 13 and June 11 all times in Club. Have to say for the price it was great. This year we were in row 1 for both legs and these are great seats but they need footrests or footstools. It was a brand new cabin new mood lighting but the service was cheerful and the drinks and snacks constant. Only problem was with trying to pre-book meals on both legs and finally gave up only to be offered what was left on the actual flight but it was good enough. The prices are creeping up. Have flown Club with them in old config and it was fine now with only 12 seats it has pushed up the price quite a bit. Still worth the money for early boarding disembarkation drinks and snacks and peace and quiet in a really small cabin. A real negative though is now in July 14 you can book flights for next year but no seat maps are open. Wonder what is going on there. I am not paying overÂ£1k for a seat I can't choose.,7/15/2014,4,3,4,4,4,8
A van der Made,1,Flight from Amsterdam to Tokyo Narita via SVO and back. First flight from AMS to SVO on codeshare flight with KLM on B738. Flight was OK. Transit on SVO from terminal E to D was a breeze. There were no lines at immigration or security check. As we had a stopover for 6 hours we used the capsule hotel which was accessible from terminal D and E on airside (63 Euros for 4 hours). Flight from SVO to NRT was on an A333. Nice and new aircraft with good seats and complete IFE. We had 4 seats in a row for the two of us as the aircraft was about half full. Crew was attentive and quitte friendy. With one hour delay we arrived at NRT. The flight from NRT back to SVO gave us however some mixed emotions. on an A333 but with a crew that wasn't as friendly as the flight to NRT. We got the feeling we were bothering them even with some basic requests for drinks. Toilets were very dirty on this flight not only the fault of the crew as well as fellow passengers. Transit from terminal D to E on SVO was a mess. At immigration and security check there were long lines with a lot of people cutting lines. Flight from SVO to AMS on an A320 was better than the flight from NRT. Aircraft was however in a bit of a run down state and also quite dirty. Toilet was also in a poor state. The crew however was extremely friendly and flight arrived on time. In the end Aeroflot gave us mixed feelings. If you don't have many expectations for the price you pay for the flight the airline is OK. At SVO you need either luck or a lot of patience concerning transits of flights. If we would fly again with this airline really depends on the price of the flights they offer.,7/6/2014,3,4,3,4,2,6
A Gittens,0,LHR-NBO-LHR. LHR-NBO departed on time aircraft was a very tired 777-200 ER NVOD didn't work food was very poor the only upside was the flight attendants who were always helpful! Seats were extremely uncomfortable and I could feel springs. Most airline food is never very good but this was awful it was very over cooked and was all stuck together. NBO-LHR departed over an hour late as aircraft was parked at the wrong part of the airport so we were made to sit in a tent on the apron in darkness until someone got fuel for a generator once on the aircraft it was again a rather tired 777-200 ER and was again in a seat which probably hasn't seen a cushion in 10 years! NVOD still didn't work which made for a long flight. Food was marginally better. Again I cannot fault cabin crew who were very attentive. Overall though it was not enough to make me want to book with KQ again.,8/21/2013,1,1,2,1,4,2
A Patel,1,Flew from BHX to YYZ on A310 had read some very negative reviews about the airline and aircraft so was very nervous about what to expect. But overall it was a good pleasant flight definitely more value for money as the fare was really cheap. Just like any other North American carrier the service and cabin wasn't what you find on Asian or European carriers but having said that the crew certainly made up for it with a great friendly attitude. Being a dual national I travel to Canada every year and have used AC/BA in the past but will certainly try to book with AT the next time.,6/9/2013,3,3,3,3,5,8
A Best,0,My wife and I flew from Belfast to Lanzarote on January 24 2013 and returned on Jan 31 2013. Flight from Belfast was on time and no problems boarding. First thing we noticed on boarding was the narrow space between the seats other passengers commented on this. When I sat down the space to the next seat was so narrow that I was unable to put the food tray down flat. I am 5 ft 5 and found that I was cramped. Other passengers who were taller than I experienced greater discomfort. There was also a lack of overhead storage for all passengers and some had to shove baggage between their legs. On the return journey we were collected from our hotel 20 minutes late. Wen we got to the airport Thomas Cook had 6 check in desks open for people boarding 4 of their flights all leaving within 15 minutes of each other. 4 desks were open for speedy boarding and Thomas Cook were actively trying to sell this service to people in the queue. As a consequence we had little time in the airport to have lunch or shop before boarding. When the plane took off and the set belt sign was switched off most passengers stood for the 4 hour journey. I have travelled with Thomas Cook in the past but their service has declined and they seem to be preoccupied with getting more and more money from passengers. As a seasoned traveller I have never seen such cramped conditions on any plane including so called budget airlines. I will never travel with Thomas Cook again and would not recommend this company to anyone.,2/2/2013,1,1,2,1,3,1
A Godfrey,1,Premium economy service downgraded. I have been a regular customer on Cathay Pacific's premium economy between Perth and Hong Kong and I have been very happy with the service until now. On my last flight Perth to Hong Kong instead of the usual hot or cold breakfast options we were given a box containing a pastry fruit salad in a tiny dish and a chocolate bar The same meal was served to economy passengers. when I asked the flight attendant where was the hot food I was informed that there had been a change to the service. Downgrade more like it. I asked for a glass of Champagne and that was served in a plastic cup. On the return sector Perth to Hong Kong we were given a hot lunch which was quite good and then around 9pm they came down with a box containing the worlds smallest chicken roll some fruit salad in a tiny plastic container and a chocolate bar. Cathay Pacific is a premium airline this food is not fit for economy let alone premium economy. They seem to have downgraded the service but not discounted the price of the ticket. I will be flying back to Hong Kong next week it will be interesting to see if they have lifted the standard of meals back to what it once was.,4/27/2015,2,4,1,4,3,5
A Paterson,0,My husband and I recently few from Sydney to Apia via Auckland. We checked in online and printed our own boarding passes to save time and lock our seats in. When we arrived at the airport we had to go through the whole process again making our online check in pointless. The first leg of the journey was on a reasonably comfortable Boeing 777-200 but the second leg was on an Airbus A320 which was one of the most cramped airline seats I've ever sat on. Both planes felt old and tired. The meal we had was adequate but nothing more. I was quite disappointed overall but one thing I'll say is the stay were very friendly and helpful.,6/20/2014,3,2,2,3,4,6
A Vanbergen,0,Flew Zurich to Brussels and back in Economy - however probably the most uneconomic flight ever: CHF 1600 (EUR 1250) for a semi-flex return. No more wifi in Zurich's Star-gold lounge from 01 January 2013 unless you have a qualifying mobile phone number (e.g +41). Flight - Uneventful all pax squeezed to the last rows albeit only 4 pax in business. Never again if I can avoid it.,1/15/2013,1,2,2,0,2,NaN

A Gohil,0,Took SAS from JTR (Santorini) to Oslo and then onto London Heathrow (LHR) on June 1 2014. SAS flight was delayed by over 6 hours in JTR. No credible reason provided by airline. Heard about all kinds of reasons such as plane arrival delay technical problem door not closing etc. Eventually plane takes off 6 hours late from JTR to Oslo. Pilot informs us in mid-flight that the plane will have to make a stop in Munich for crew change. All 70+ passengers were fully frustrated with the sheer incompetence of SAS staff and the lack of proper communication to the passengers. Majority of passengers were flying to LHR from Oslo. However SAS would not help make arrangements from Munich to LHR for any of the passengers. Instead told passengers to wait 2 more hours in Munich and get back on the plane to Oslo. Lost complete faith in SAS' ability to get its passengers home in a timely manner. No care of duty shown towards its passengers. SAS had no staff providing any info in JTR airport nor in Munich. Limited communication from Lufthansa reps on behalf of SAS at the gate in Munich. My family and I decided to abandon our SAS flight in Munich and ended up buying separate tickets from Munich to LHR on British Airways. Not sure if I will ever fly SAS.,6/4/2014,1,1,3,1,1,NaN

A Vermeulen,1,LHR-JNB. From Check-in to baggage collection SAA service was flawless. Air stewards friendly food was as good as airline food can get (mediocre) but not worse than any of SAA's competitors. Aircraft was clean and staff was generally friendlier than other airline staff. I will fly with them again.,2/13/2013,3,3,5,4,5,9
A Bevan,1,Business class LGW-IST-BKK / BKK-IST-LHR. Having read several reviews particularly around the level of business class service we were somewhat apprehensive prior to travelling. In the event we found the overall product to be high quality and at an operational level all flights departed on time and allowed connections to be made easily. It is true that its down to you to request drinks throughout the flight but requests were met in a friendly way. In fact there was certainly no lack of friendliness or smiles from the cabin crew unlike other reviews on this site. Comfort levels were great in the A330 flat bed sectors the London to IST sectors on the A321 compare very favourably to other carriers short haul business class. The lounge at IST is also to be highly commended although very busy (xmas). Overall we were very satisfied all round and would use them again and would recommend.,1/3/2014,5,5,4,4,4,9
A Pease,0,"I'm starting to fly this route more regularly, and for the first time have to report what I consider to be a significant failing with the cabin crew. Our plane (FR7974) left late (after a late inbound arrival). I was sitting in Row 2. There was a minimal announcement from the flight deck naming the crew but nothing to invite the passengers to listen attentively to the safety briefing, which is often the final point made during the cockpit pre-flight passenger announcement. The announcement was very quiet and the delivery was monotone. I appreciate that the flight deck crew wanted to get a slot and head back to London as quickly as possible so their priorities might be elsewhere. The pasenger safety briefing was voiced by the female cabin crew member but it was impossible to hear (even in row 2). Even the young man doing the demonstration seemed frustrated by the lack of interest being shown. When I asked the female cabin crew why she had not stopped the briefing and reminded the passengers to pay attention, she told me it was not really worth it, because 'they (the passengers) wouldn't do it and anyway they fly so regularly that they don't need to listen to it because they know what to do by now'. The drinks run and duty free run were very speedy, leading to the crew spending around 10 mins in the forward galley area spilling out into the aisle in full sight of the passengers each with a mobile phone in their hand and chatting. Apart from the young man cabin crew at the front who made a personal, animated and delightful appeal for the scratch card run, and whose cabin service was friendly and most welcome, this cabin crew seemed to be the most uninterested and switched off that I have travelled with in over 15 years of travelling with Ryanair. Very disappointing. ",7/20/2015,5,4,NaN,NaN,1,2
A Vlasov,1,LTN to LJU outbound with CRJ200 return with CRJ900. Both legs on time. Just a tiny sandwich and only one round of drinks but ok for a 2 hr flight. Slow and unfriendly staff. Very little room in CRJ200 even though it was not full. Passengers had to pick up their luggage from hold upon arrival to LJU and carry the bags to the terminal building.,6/17/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,5
A Goldring,1,MEL to BKK via SYD. Qantas at its best. FA's were wonderful on all sectors. Drinks were never empty food was great (and I was a little concerned on that front in advance of the fight given some of the reviews) and well timed. Flight from SYD delayed an hour due to some twit that went missing then thought it was hilarious keeping a 747 load of people waiting! For anyone that has bitterness write about QF try flying in the US. Australians are spoilt with service from QF.,12/20/2013,4,4,5,4,5,10
A Bigelow,0,YVR-HKG on 777 High Density configuration. Everyone must avoid this 777! Even if this flight was a few hundred dollars less than competition (which it's not) I'd still avoid it. I am Elite Air Canada and would never fly this plane (trying to see if I can change my return flight). Seats are so cramped that it shames low-cost airlines not only you do you not have enough room but the seats are also very uncomfortable the controls are inaccessible (on the armrests) and recline is very limited. Due to extreme high density service is slow and very poor there's no duty free on a 14hr flight! There's absolutely not enough lavatories for the number of people this plane carries. From what I've heard the business class is also horrendous.,6/1/2014,1,1,2,3,2,1
A von Friedeburg,1,Took Air China for the first time on my first trip to China - from LAX to PEK on Jun 21 and PEK to IAD on Jul 10. Based on some negative reviews on this and other sites I was a bit worried about spending 12-14 hours on an old plane with lousy service bad food and non-English speaking staff. My expectations were completely shattered: our plane was the latest Airbus model seats were very comfortable the flight attendants very attentive and polite all spoke English and the movie selection was just fine. First time travelers to China are well advised to choose Air China. Moreover the passport and custom controls at Beijing Airport beat almost any US and European standards in terms of ease and friendliness.,7/15/2014,5,5,4,4,5,10
A Goodwin,0,We found it unacceptable being placed in a side room being used to re- charge batteries for electric vehicles! A large group of disabled passengers were left in this dreadful room. Only seating was non upholstered dropdown metal seats with a narrow gap between them. There was inadequate space to pass resulting in feet being stood on and legs being banged every time someone needed to pass. When we arrived in Manchester staff had forgotten to request wheelchairs. In all made to feel like third class citizens. Don't accept disabled passengers if you don't want to look after them. There was very little help for us on this airline.,1/21/2015,3,4,3,2,1,5
A Pedersen,1,CPH-CAI-DAR return. Tickets heavily discounted good value. Check in with automats in CPH airport waste of time as boarding cards and luggage tags are only provided. Special food good 2 options for hot meal given on all routes for other passengers. No alcoholic drinks free or for purchase. Quite disappointing for several passengers. A lot of soft drinks and juices provided. In Cairo a lot of waiting taxi-ing remote parking of aircraft within the airport caused 1 hour unnecessary arrival delay.,4/20/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,6
A W Butler,1,"We have flown Hawaiian airlines about 8 times, and it has been satisfying every time. The service is very good, the seat is comfortable (especially the pillows), the food is pretty good and the legroom is comfortable. We fly this airline about once every two years, and it's been very satisfying. They are kid friendly too.",7/20/2015,3,3,4,3,4,7
A Gracia,0,JFK-PTY-REC and REC-PTY. Return segment from PTY-EWR was with United. The most direct route to Recife from NYC with a Star Alliance Carrier that I could find. For business class the tickets were comparatively cheap. All flights were on 737s which were refurbished. Continental equipment. Business cabin was the same as you would get on a domestic US flight. Seats didn't recline much no foot rests no in seat power and overhead monitors. Vegetarian food options were bad mostly soggy grilled vegetables and tiny portions. They also seem to have barely enough for the people onboard. They also seem to ration the alcohol and don't serve it very willingly. On the PTY-REC flights they serve a snack first instead of a meal. They serve the meal 2 hrs before you land at 11 pm at night. On the flight from REC-PTY they didn't turn on the entertainment system. Overall the airline served a purpose it got me to Recife from NYC in the least amount of time and with Star Alliance but I wouldn't fly them again if I had a choice.,6/3/2013,4,3,2,1,3,4
A Bittermann,1,FRA-BKK with onward flight on Thai Airways to SYD. Excellent service by ground staff and cabin crew. Food was outstanding and I managed to sleep throughout the flight. Return flight connecting from SIN on SQ970. BKK-FRA also in F then FRA-HAM in Business. Again a good overall experience though I have to comment on the ground services upon my arrival in FRA. The flight was delayed and it was almost impossible to get to the next gate on time. I would have expected some kind of assistance by LH ground staff in order to make my connection. Other airlines offer this service even to their business class passengers. This could certainly be improved. Both long haul flights were on a A340 with the old First Class.,5/19/2014,4,4,5,3,4,9
A Pedersen,1,BNE-HIR-BNE. BNE connection is operated by Strategic Airlines. Service BNE-HIR-BNE excellent like a party on board with plenty of food and endless drinks. Luggage allowance flexible. Punctuality quite good. Domestic no service on board - had only one cancellation (due to puncture on remote Island of Gizo). However hotel and care quickly provided until next morning. Small aircraft on domestic routes noisy.,10/22/2011,3,3,0,0,4,6
A Walker,0,We are currently onboard Spirit Flight 710 that landed at LaGuardia airport on time on Sunday October 19. Upon arrival the pilot announced that another aircraft was loading passengers at our gate and we would be at the gate within 15 minutes. It is now over an hour later and we are still not at our gate no further announcements. The pilot has announced that the FAA is completing the log book and the flight attendants should provide us complimentary snacks and drinks. Only one gate for this flight and no plan B is on of their continued problem and the lack of customer service is another major issues. Any consideration for sending a bus and have us deplane? The plane is freezing cold! We were doing fine until we finally landed and after not flying Spirit for a while owing to the poor and consistently horrific customer service my return has been met with another horror ending. Spirit do us a favour and do not expand until you improve your existing services.,10/28/2014,2,2,2,1,3,2
A Black,0,Sydney-Perth Saturday afternoon service. Unfortunately the weekend flights use the older aircraft and not the new Airbus A330s with lie flat seats. Cabin manager is assigned to business class only (4 passengers) and was attentive upon boarding hanging my jacket and offering beverages with a choice of water or a mocktail there was no champagne or sparkling to be seen. After take off we were offered beverages and our meal orders were taken. The samsung in flight entertainment systems were handed out however after looking through the selection I instantly regretted not bringing my own laptop as the selection for a 5hr flight was extremely poor. The 3 course meal was delicious and service was good for most of the flight however I had to wait for the bathroom twice the first time as several economy passengers were using the designated business class bathroom and the second time as 4 members of the crew were talking in the front of the cabin blocking the way. After waiting 15 minutes for them to disburse I stepped through the curtain only to be told that I couldn't be up there and to return to my seat. A few minutes later I was approached by the cabin manager to explain that the first officer was coming out of the cockpit and that is why I was told to return to my seat. I wasn't happy with how they handled the situation. The amenities kit was good however it was not handed out until half way through the flight. Overall it was a pretty disappointing the best part of the trip was the priority baggage.,8/6/2013,2,4,4,1,3,5
A Gray,0,Just returned with my family to Newcastle from Tenerife 15 hours late. Informed that aircraft had arrived Tenerife at 8pm having experienced an in-flight technical fault. Return flight at 9.30pm finally cancelled at 11.00pm. Parts we were informed being flown out from UK. Coached at 12.30am to overnight accommodation. Temperatures 28deg + but accommodated in non-air conditioned hotel in a very noisy resort. To Jet2's credit they flew out a replacement aircraft when it was found that the original aircraft could not be repaired as expected. This is the second 12 hour + delay we have experienced with Jet2 - and we've only flown with them twice! We would not consider flying Jet2 again certainly not until they start to provide modern reliable aircraft on their services.,9/4/2012,2,3,3,NaN,3,2
A Pessuto,0,"I am from Brazil and live in the UK so use TAM almost every year. Although the service is reasonable there is always something to be desired. I book my flights well in advance leaving enough time for connections usually closer to the time they simply change the times making the connections rather challenging. In the last episode TAM changed the flight times in such a way that it left me with under 2 hours to connect. Anyone who has been to Brazil before will know that this is impractical as you need to go through immigration at the first international airport you land before proceeding to the domestic connection. We were stuck in long queues at immigration and long queues at the check-in desk to board the connection flight. TAM did absolutely nothing to prioritise us knowing we would be late. In fact TAM simply told us to remain in the queue and believe me everyone from that flight which needed to catch the onward flight ""conveniently"" missed the flight. We were then accommodated to the next flight which had a stop-over on the way and we left inside the aircraft parked by the gates for over two hours! In summary what was meant to be a very smooth flight turned out to be a nightmare with a total delay of 2.5 hours. Not great when you have toddlers with you!",12/12/2011,3,4,3,3,2,2
A Walster,1,DUS-MAD in class S (economy) in seat 11C. Duration: 2 hours. I was very surprised with the service and comfort on board because we flew in a CRJ-9000. My regulation sized cabin baggage only just fit inside. It was an early morning flight and a breakfast of scrambled eggs spinach and potato cubes was served together with orange juice and a biscuit - all in all pretty good for economy class on such a small aircraft. Comfortable flight overall with two rounds of drinks service. Excellent landing. All in all an excellent flight.,2/12/2013,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
A Greenstone,1,Flew Kuwait-Frankfurt business class via Airbus 330-300 then Frankfurt-Miami Business Class on the Airbus 330-800. Service was fine and efficient as is typical of Lufthansa. The comfort was awful-seats were so narrow and hard. The worst I have experienced frankly. Never again will I fly them-especially spending all that money on business class.,4/27/2015,3,1,5,3,5,6
A Blake,0,This was the worst flying experience of our lives. We were lied to repeatedly by staff on both ends of our flight they blamed staff in the other location for our flight problems. They held us in the airport for 4 hours and promised repeatedly we would make our 2 connecting flights meanwhile many flights were going off the island and they held us without putting us on other flights. After telling us our connection would be held for us (11 passengers we making this connection) they rushed us off the plane to tell us our connection was leaving without us. We demanded they take us to the plane and they refused. After hours of deliberation they offered us flights in lieu that were clearly the lowest in value with large lay-overs and that got us home over a day later than we had planned to be home. The attendant assured us all mix-ups result in first class flights to our destination. We confirmed this with her twice. After staying in a hotel with $10 compensation voucher for our trouble we checked in to learn that the flights were lowest price economy. Again we were lied to. A manager told me he was not responsible for what his staff said to us and could not do anything about the mix-up on our flight class.,11/19/2013,1,1,1,1,1,1
A Peters,0,WDH-TXL. Flight attendants could be friendlier. Once in Berlin transit security staff in Berlin took me too late to the gate and I stood on the bridge and watched in dismay as my LHR connecting flight departed without me and my young daughter while security staff were busy talking on the ground next to my bumped luggage. 2 hours later security staff demanded USD2000 from me to rebook my missed flights via LHR to Chicago claiming that this was because I had no airport transit visa. When I explained that there was a fax from BA about my arrival and connecting flight and the tardiness of the security staff I was rebooked without charge but no apology. Air Berlin told me that they were not British Airways although the flight showed their name and number as well yet they simply cancelled my Chicago-Des Moines confirmed reservation on American Airlines without explanation. This is extremely poor service from a OneWorld partner.,6/12/2012,4,4,4,4,2,2
A Griggs,0,"Typically the airline never fails to disappoint. I Flew KUL-BKK. Our flight was rescheduled from a 23.25 flight to 01.25 for no reason whatsoever. We had pre allocated EMEX seats however on boarding our boarding passes flashed as ""not correct seats"" and once on board we found that we were actually 2 rows behind the exit! As usual the crew insisted on serving a meal at 2am even though everyone just wanted to sleep for the short flight. On arrival we had to wait at immigration for 15 minutes as no arrival cards were provided on board and there were none left at the airport on arrival.",7/28/2013,2,2,1,1,1,2
A Walton,1,London Heathrow to Delhi and Delhi to Kathmandu. I found the service to be excellent. Staff were friendly and helpful the food was good and the entertainment on the Heathrow to Delhi Delhi to Heathrow legs had a wide selection of films games and information to suit all tastes and cultures. I would definitely fly them again.,10/29/2012,4,4,4,5,5,9
A Bland,1,SOF-LHR on A319. Flight on-time sandwiches good (and had separate vegetarian option) choice and quality of drinks good and staff polite and efficient. No complaints at all and would definitely fly with Bulgaria Air again.,5/16/2013,4,4,4,0,4,9
A Petersen,0,CPH-GOT-STO-CPH all on SK. Planes were clean and all flights on time and uneventful so SK delivered the basics OK. A cup of coffee was offered on all flights in SAS GO. Crews appeared to try but generally passion and friendliness was lacking. There was very little passenger contact other than the most basic.,1/10/2014,3,3,0,0,2,3
A Waters,0,My return flight from Paphos was arranged via Thomson I have no idea why I couldn't fly back with Thomson the reason was not explained and they still charged me Â£320. I have never flown with a budget airline before and it would not be my choice to do so in the future. Uncomfortable seats very little choice re food options staff refused to take euros staff caused a fuss about me having only Â£20 note because they had no change. No entertainment (although you could buy an entertainment kit at Â£7) naive staff with very little experience confidence or charm. I would not want to be caught on a Jet2 flight where there was a problem as I don't think their staff could cope. A dreadful experience I won't be repeating albeit I had no choice in the first place.,10/3/2012,1,1,1,NaN,1,1
A Bland,0,This airline is terrible! Timetable changes (moving flights to different days rather than times) after you've booked are unacceptable when people have already made non-refundable bookings for ground transportation and hotels etc). Wizzair do this with appalling regularity and with no regards for the effect on its customers.,7/15/2010,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Grotenhuis,1,DUS to ATH and 4 days later from ATH to HER. Both flights on time very quick check-in and boarding. Very friendly and attentive efficient staff good service excellent melas even for the short hub from ATH to HER. It will remain our preferred carrier to and from Greece.,7/14/2013,4,4,5,0,5,9
A Phadnis,1,Travelled on Mumbai-Bhubaneshar Sector last week. Aircraft A319. Flight pulled back on time. Ticket Price almost on par to those offered on low cost carriers. Still received sumptuous and tasty complimentary breakfast. Only airline to not charge pre-seat selection charges. The plane was well maintained and crew efficient. Only grouse may be that IFE was not made operational on this flight.,9/1/2013,5,5,5,0,5,9
A Webb,1,I fly on Sun Country on a somewhat regular basis and try to fly them whenever possible. On my latest flight to San Diego from MSP everything went very smoothly. The staff are very attentive and accommodating. The only things that are less than perfect was the seat condition which was a little worn and the in-flight entertainment is a Digi-Player instead of a seatback screen. Other than that they are my hometown airline.,5/15/2013,5,4,4,3,5,10
A Guilbert,1,LHR-EZE via GRU out and GIG back. Best price I found for route with short connections. I thought legroom reasonable for economy. Food OK on long haul but the dry cheese and ham roll on connecting flights a let down. Entertainment good - mix of new releases and good older films. Re comments about FAs - right or wrong I have found on all South America routes you are expected to go and get any nuts drinks snacks etc from them works like a bar. They were helpful with warm milk for the kids and moving our seats on the way back (arm rests wouldn't lift up for kids to sleep). Luggage went through connections fine to other end including 2 piece pushchair left at door of aeroplane at first leg of each trip. First experience with TAM and would be happy to use again based on this experience.,5/12/2013,5,4,3,4,3,8
A Boge,0,This is an airline to be avoided. I paid top dollar for a flight from Madrid to Milan because it was an integral part of a European vacation. I knew I was being had at the time when I saw that the same trip could be booked late for a fraction of what I paid (but I was prepared to live with that because I needed to certainty of knowing the flight was booked). What I cannot accept is the appalling service at check-in. Why do they even bother to have an on-line service - it means nothing. On top of that they have lost my baggage.,9/22/2013,1,2,0,0,1,NaN
A Weinberg,1,Flew Sydney to Bali return on Garuda's A330. Business class passengers use the Qantas lounge at Sydney Airport - great food and plenty of seating even during the morning rush. Unfortunately the flight was delayed 7 hours due to mechanical issues but the ground staff handled it pretty well. The flight itself - food was of high quality (and lots of it) service attentive and friendly seats comfortable (180 degree lie flat) entertainment fairly decent. On-board immigration was a great plus. Overall a solid business class product that beats all other competitors on that route (in terms of value and quality).,12/25/2013,5,4,4,3,4,8
A Phillipou,1,Heathrow to Thessaloniki via Athens. Stress free check in at the new Terminal Two at Heathrow. Comfortable flight with adequate inflight hospitality with very friendly crew on all flights. Baggage checked through to our final destination and seamless transfer of flights in Athens. Clean and new Airbus A321/320 on all flights. Excellent experience would definitely fly them again.,3/28/2015,4,4,3,0,5,9
A Guo,1,DLC-PEK in domestic first class 1 hour short trip. Check-in and security was fast. I enjoyed the lounge it was quiet and clean and had some Chinese stir-fries for dinner. Boarded on time. Seat was typical recliner on a narrow-body jet but comfortable enough for the flight. Drinks and some snacks (a plate of fruit which isn't fresh and some cookies) offered. Entertainment drop down TV but no headphones. Plane didn't park at the terminal but a minibus was waiting for first-class passengers. Crew friendly.,5/24/2014,4,4,4,2,4,8
A Boubekeur,0,I have decided to give up on Air Algerie after waiting nearly 3 days for a flight from Heathrow with 2 small children. The airline is a joke - you have to wait at least 3 hours before they tell you your not flying. We had 2 pay for my 2 young children nearly the full fare and then was told to give up a seat as they had overbooked. I am not from Algeria my husband is though - Algeria is like my second home. I feel that the Air Algerie gives the country a bad name - it should pull its socks up and start following the other airlines.,10/1/2006,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Welling,0,"Flew from Hong Kong to San Fran and around the US in late May. I am not a fussy flyer at all and can usually go to sleep easily. I am also an Aussie meaning I am used to the 'service' Qantas provides. However after my experience with United I am going to go easy on Qantas. I'll start my review with - ""wow"". It actually takes more effort than less to be as terrible as United. From the no entertainment system on-board (standard I'm told on a 12 hour flight) terrible food (I live in Asia and I know what bad food is) multiple gate changes (5 in total in 1 hour) and 2 hour delay (no apology). Then there was the possibly the rudest individuals I've ever met posing as flight attendants. I am not sure who employed these folk or why on earth they decided to work in the service industry but they were not only dismissive cold and patronising towards guests they actually made the whole flight a tense and uncomfortable environment. In summary I don't understand UA's play. They act like a lowâ€™ cost airline. I say 'low low' because the majority of low cost airlines play in the mid tier now. As a national carrier I don't understand this. They can't beat Southwest so you'd think service would be a priority. Manners are free last time I checked. Once again it takes more effort to be that terrible then it would to provide a half decent service. They are too many alternatives to put yourself through a UA experience. The most interesting part of this is all they have to do is look at Qantas and others who behaved like this in the late 90s and ended up losing half of their market share and have been struggling since. Your people are your business.",6/25/2014,1,3,1,1,1,1
A Phlorides,0,I was supposed to fly out of Adelaide on 27 April 2011 to Melbourne and was told as I checked in (with four other family members) that the flight was cancelled and they booked us on a flight for 29 April 2011 to Melbourne at 7.30 am . After arriving to check in and waiting 4 hours they told us the flight was cancelled 'again'. Offering me a refund in 48 hours I had to find another carrier to fly home with. Cancelling a flight once was very disappointing but twice just reflects that these people should not run an airline. Reason for the cancellation was not given apart from operational reasons. Hopefully CASA shuts them down.,4/29/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Bouzid,1,Flew 30th March 2015 LHR-YVR return with my school on a rugby tour (27 people). Seats were reasonably comfortable and they catered to my food requests of no pork well. Enjoyed it. But the IFE was absolutely horrendous and did not meet my expectations of British Airways- outdated movies with TV shows from 3 months before. Since we were flying on a Boeing 747-400 there were more seats per aisle but this made the cabin feel quite cramped. One recommendation for them - put fewer seats per aisle! Even though there were negatives flying outbound I have to say the return was great. I had swapped seats with another boy who wanted to sit next to someone so I sat in the extra legroom seats. IFE was far better and due to having the window seat I was able to sleep for around 6 hours when I was awoke by the breakfast/snack which was decent. Food had no flavour and was quite spicy (Lentil masala) but still edible. Although my experience on BA84 was very enjoyable I heard many of my companions had to move seats because of the not working IFE. One of my coaches had ordered orange juice so the cabin crew gave it to him as they were serving but then the other one would take it away for some reason and in the end they said they had none left. He had flown with Cathay Pacific to Manila the preceding week and he said that he had enjoyed that thoroughly. One of his worst experiences of air travel especially due to him being 6'4 and rather large. Overall a decent experience but just met my expectations. To improve British Airways need to start to be able to compete with other airlines like Singapore Emirates Etihad Cathay Pacific and Qantas as there service and level of comfort has definitely taken over from BA.,4/10/2015,3,4,4,2,4,7
A Pineda,0,First and last experience with Iberia. They are by far the worse airline we have ever flown and will never use them again. They do not allow the customer to choose their seats until 24 hours prior to the flight unless you are willing to pay an additional $40.00 per ticket which they do not disclose to you until after you have made your purchase. When you finally go in 24 hours prior to your flight their system selects your seats and even if you are flying as a family they do not give you seats together forcing you to pay the $40.00 per person to change the seats at their counter which you did not even select to begin with.,12/4/2014,1,1,1,3,1,NaN
A Went,1,"First experience flying Small Planet was a great success. We often go to Greece to visit family in Volos and usually fly EasyJet to Thessaloniki. Our flight from Gatwick to Volos via Skiathos on 31st May was a bit late leaving due to bad weather at Gatwick. The plane was not Small Planet but had been chartered from Air Afriqiyah but flew with Small Planet crew. Most passengers were flying in and out of Skiathos with only six on to Volos. The plane was cleaned and restocked efficiently at Skiathos while the six remained on board. We flew direct home from Volos a week later on a Small Planet plane. On both flights the crew were friendly, helpful and professional. The planes were clean, well stocked, seats comfortable and legroom adequate for a short haul with the Small Planet plane appearing quite new. We were very happy with all aspects of our flights and will certainly use Small Planet again to Volos.",6/13/2015,4,5,4,NaN,5,10

A Whitehouse,1,"I flew from Heathrow to Seattle. To be honest I was dreading the flight as I had read some really bad reviews of Delta. But it was excellent. The seat back screens were the biggest I have seen in Economy - with a great selection of films TV shows and music. The food whilst being obviously ""airline food"" was nice enough and lots of it. They listed only one meal - lunch - on the website but they served two more rounds of snacks throughout the flight - an ok sandwich and a really nice calzone. The staff were really friendly as well. Again I was dreading the service as a lot of other reviews mentioned their bad attitude. But the ones on my flight were lovely. Not sure if this is a sign of better things to come from Delta or by the fact that the route is brand new for them but it was a great flight.",6/12/2014,3,3,4,5,5,9
A Wild,1,VS085 on 15 Sep 2013 out of Manchester UK. Traveled with most airlines to USA but this first time with Virgin from Manchester to Las Vegas was by far the best experience yet. Flight attendants were pleasant and attentive The food was surprisingly good and plenty of it. Seating was typical of all economy cabins. Will definitely use again.,10/1/2013,3,3,5,4,5,10
A Bowles,0,I felt a bit let down by this airline. We travelled as a couple long haul. We couldn't sit together on either leg of the trip as we didn't pay extra (Â£15 each each way) this was quite a big deal to us. There wasn't as much choice of movies/entertainment as the bigger airlines. Also the refreshments were pretty poor. There was only 2 complimentary coffees throughout the whole of the flight. Every other drink had to be paid for. Also I found it a bit cringey how they kept pointing out the different classes of the plane. For example telling economy customers not to pass the premium curtain under any circumstances or use their toilets. The seats are uncomfortable for long haul. The only benefit I found of the Dreamliner was the bigger windows.,9/28/2014,4,2,3,3,3,4
A Willacy,0,Flew to Rhodes from Manchester on 22nd September. 5 minutes before gate opened were told we'd have to be bussed to East Midlands. Three 52 seater coaches showed up for over 200 people. Do the maths. When at East Midlands airport flight was delayed for a further 30 minutes. Given Â£6 vouchers each as compensation. Didn't cover the cost of a coffee and sandwich. Flight back from Rhodes on 29th September was late by over 2 hours. Won't be flying Thomas Cook airlines again.,10/1/2012,2,2,1,0,3,2
A Polczynski,0,Worst experience with Air Berlin was my first and will be my last. Flying from TXL to GDN and the flight was cancelled at the last minute no extra information was given and the boarding screen was just switched off so no one knew what was going on. Then we had to stand in a line for over 2 hours to be told that there were no flights for a few days after which was unacceptable. Then it was the whole process of finding the luggage to collect and the staff were so rude and unhelpful.,9/24/2013,1,3,0,0,1,NaN
A Willis,0,HKG-YYZ a few months ago. First of all got thoroughly duped on their website with their infamously tricky pricing process. When they say 'total price' they still have not added their 15-20% additional carrier fees which they disguise as taxes. After arriving at the airport I am informed the flight is delayed 30 minutes. Once arriving at the gate I am then informed they have changed the gate and that the flight is now 45 minutes delayed. When I arrive at the new gate they have extended the delay by 15 minutes and then a few minutes later they covertly increase it by 15 minutes. So we're an hour and 15 minutes late out of the gate and the captain comes on and blames the typhoon (which was only a T1 and no other flights were delayed that I could see). The aircraft is tired and the cabin crew look about the same. After 15 hours of a very uncharming and shameless money grabbing experience (advertisements everywhere - before every video you watch about 3 of them and about 5 reminders of the duty free items being offered) we arrive at YYZ with the pilots not having made up any time at all likely to save fuel. The airline is obviously in financial distress (see the latest report) and it's been consistently poorly managed for the last few years. Another legacy carrier to add to the 3-4 star category methinks.,10/28/2013,1,4,3,3,2,3
A Bradley,1,"My family and I had a Manila - Caticlan flight and it couldn't have gone any smoother. We were running late for our check in as there was a car accident on the way and we thought that we would miss our flight. Luckily as we arrived at the counter they were just putting the ""closed"" sign up and they put us through. One of our group member hadn't pre-purchased the baggage allowance so that took a few more minutes to put through. As we were on our way to the gate we heard our names being called and made a quick dash to the gate and again as we arrived the were just closing the gate and they quickly called the bus over to take us to the tarmac! We found them to be very helpful and accommodating. Would definitely travel with them again.",8/11/2014,3,4,0,0,5,8
A Pontes,1,Flew back MUN-JHNB SA265. Full flight. Whole in-flight system was in-operative as well as the seats. Meals was good and service is friendly. Was able to sleep on the flat-bed as the seats can be operated manually but it was a struggle and noisy for the staff to set up. I think the staff service was good in the challenging circumstances but thought poorly of the equipment of the aircraft not being in working order. Despite the apologies from the staff on board I think an apology from head-office is required.,7/22/2012,3,3,4,0,4,6
A Popescu,1,Bacau-Brussels return. Pleasant flight although shortly delayed apologies given by Cabin crew after boarding. Cabin crew were nice and helpful and seemed interested in our comfort. Plane was rather old but ok. Bacau Airport is very small with only 2 check-in desks. Ticket price was more than fair.,8/23/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,10
A Bradshaw,1,DYU to FRA: Somon Air flights are very difficult to book outside Tajikstan so although their flight times suited me I ended up booking my outbound flight to Tajikstan with Turkish Air. I did manage to book my return flight with some local help whilst in Tajikstan and was pleasantly surprised. Aircraft was a new Boeing 737-900 flight was comfortable and the cabin crew very good. There were only approx 60 passengers on the flight which is probably more to do with the problems booking rather than the quality of their service. There is no TV IFE but as most of the Somon Air flights are through the night this wasn't a problem. I wouldn't put anyone off flying with Somon Air but they really do need to offer flight booking outside Tajikstan with the major travel agents in order to be competitive.,11/14/2012,4,4,3,2,4,6
A Wilson,1,"BHX-ORD-CDG 27th June. No major concerns or upsets but certainly much room for improvement. The online check-in was very straightforward (I appreciated the e-mail confirming that check in had opened) and there were no issues there. The outward leg from BHX to CDG was fine, didn't expect to be served a snack but the croissant was practically inedible and thrown straight in the bin. The organisation at CDG was lacking. There was a delay of 45 minutes on the ground with no explanation from the staff, then the gate of departure was changed to a gate that was already boarding a separate flight to Dubai, with the new gate's screen not being updated to reflect this. This caused a large rush of people and a lot of anger and confusion, and although the staff did make an announcement confirming the Chicago-bound passengers were to board first, this didn't feel like enough as a lot of people remained confused and unsure of what was happening. We were then delayed for a further hour on the tarmac, although we were kept updated by the captain regarding this. Seats were okay, food was okay, a good selection of entertainment but the quality of the screens is poor and the sets only designed for the headsets handed out so sound quality was abysmal on normal headphones. There's a good selection of drinks (including complementary alcohol) and the flight staff were friendly and attentive. Not the best trans-atlantic flight I've ever had, but far from the worst. Return flight (BOS-CDG-BHX) was also Air France but was code shared with Delta and Flybe, so will be reviewing separately.",7/13/2015,3,3,4,2,4,6
A Gurung,1,KTM-IST-LHR 28/12/2013. A330-300 flight from KTM was delayed around 5 hours. Not much information given apart from aircraft was circling above probably due to fog but other flights although smaller jets landed up to 2 hours earlier. On board aircraft had no personal screens and on take off the Captain announced there would be no IFE with no reason given. Transit at IST should have been 6 hours but due to the delay we had a 1 hour transfer so a rush to the departure gate. Flight to LHR arrived a half hour early but checked in baggage was left in IST. This was delivered on the next flight and delivered by courier the next day.,1/22/2014,4,3,3,1,3,5
A Powile,0,I flew HND to CDG on the new Business Class. The seat is far better. Service and food always good. One small issue: new entertainment system takes at least 20 minutes to understand unless you are a specialist. Typically French: not intuitive at all complex and could have been much better if tested on real customers. Once you understand how to use it one must admit the offer is great. One big problem: they have only two toilets for business class (65 seats!) ! They had three before! Surprise surprise everybody waits in line for ages! This is a terrible mistake they made! The funny thing is that they want to upscale!,4/17/2015,2,5,5,3,5,3
A Bratt,0,We used Air Madagascar for four internal flights. All four were reasonably on time (max delay about 45 mins). Cabin staff friendly and good complimentary snack and newspaper on each flight. Be prepared for very rapid braking at fort Dauphin (short runway),10/27/2008,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,4
A Gwaltney,0,"Have had issues with two previous flights on Icelandair but continued to book with them as their sales are generally good. Have finally decided however that you get what you pay for. I will never fly this miserable airline again. Major delays when flying to Europe due to their strike. This is unacceptable. They had plenty of advance warning and could easily have planned ahead. (And I was flying on a ""non strike"" day.) When British Airways went on strike several years ago management actually worked as flight attendants to prevent interruption to their service. That is customer service and Icelandair should pay attention. No one at the Icelandair customer service kiosks (in any airport) seems to know what's up. Relatives attempting to monitor flights cannot get necessary information online due to poor computer software services. Poor seating onboard. Miserable food service. The only thing of value is their inflight entertainment service. In the future I will fly another airline regardless of where I am going even if the cost is double.",5/18/2014,1,2,1,4,1,1
A Wilson,1,"MSY to BOS on 6th July. I was initially confused and frustrated by the online check in process - they assign seats upon arrival at the gate, and you can only reserve online if you wish to pay for 'More Space' seats in advance. Both the phone and Twitter operatives were helpful when I raised this with them. We arrived at the gate with about an hour to spare, gate staff could not have been more helpful. We asked to have two seats together and were told that this would be resolved once the staff had logged in. 15 minutes later, we were called to the desk and found that we had been assigned to More Legroom at no extra cost. We were delighted with this and the seats were very comfortable. We also loved the DirectTv and Sirius Radio live streaming to the aircraft, a unique touch. The unlimited soft drinks and snacks were appreciated. The flight staff were attentive and approachable. The captain coming out to make the pre-flight briefing personally was a great touch. There was an on-ground delay of an hour due to bad weather in Washington, but the captain kept us fully informed of everything that was going on and since they had the foresight to switch the entertainment on prior to take-off (why doesn't every airline do that), we barely noticed.

A Price,0,January 20 out of Victoria to Vancouver. Vancouver to Los Cabos. Return flight January 27 Los Cabos to Vancouver with a connector to Victoria that was cancelled due to fog. It would have been nice for a disclaimer to be printed on E-ticket - no complimentary food. Lovely menu card with only 2 to 3 items actually on the plane. Expensive! Flew Air Canada 12 yrs ago flew again this January 2014 - it will be another 12 yrs before we fly Air Canada again.

A Brock,1,"Glasgow to Faro (Portugal) on a package deal to Brisa Sol Aparthotel in Albufeira. Flight out was hassle-free and smooth the plane quite comfortable apart from the usual lack of elbow room. Where Jet2 fall down a bit is on arrival at the airport - on exit from the arrival area there should be a rep at the exit to point you to the Jet2 desk but if there was we didn't spot them. The desks themselves were over at the side wall of the exit hall in the opposite direction to the main doors so we had to double back to find them. Given somewhat vague directions to the bus park. Over main problem however was with the car hire arranged through Jet2 Car Rental. Flight back was OK although that plane was a little less comfortable than the outward flight - the seats seemed rather hard. We could do without ""Radio Jet2"" assailing us constantly while waiting for take-off though thankfully silenced during the flight. Overall fairly good experience would certainly use Jet2 again with just a little attention to detail could be excellent.",5/14/2013,4,3,0,NaN,4,8
A Pritchard,1,London Gatwick-Moscow Domodedovo. Extremely cheap fare flight uneventful and average aside from ridiculous queue of over an hour at bag drop also it seemed anyone going to Moscow had to have their visa number personally read to an Easyjet supervisor by phone which was strange and caused a huge wait.,7/7/2013,5,4,0,NaN,4,7
A Haig,0,Palma to Edinburgh 11th June. Absolute nightmare 21 hour flight delay in total. We went through hell with Thomson pushing the flight back on several occasions and then eventually cancelling it at 2.30 am on the 12th. Thomson knew this flight was never going to take off on the 11th and still they would not come clean and cancel it at a decent time of day. We were bussed to hotels at 4.00 am back to the airport at 11.00 am and did not take off until 4.30pm on 12th. Thomson staff on the ground at Palma were non existent. If it had not been for the captain and cabin crew on our flight we might still be in Palma airport!,8/18/2013,2,3,3,3,5,NaN
A Wisniewski,1,FRA-TXL. The check-in area was nice and fast. The plane was in good shape left on time and they served a snack. Flight attendants were very attentive. Upon exiting the plane they handed out chocolates. Would happily fly them again.,5/2/2012,5,4,5,0,5,9
A Proschel,1,We always fly with virgin in premium economy. The whole experience depends mainly on which crew are onboard. Some crews are excellent others leave much to be desired. On our last return from Orlando we were in the front half of the 'bubble' with economy behind. This is really not good as toilets only at front so the whole flight children were running up and down and people queuing constantly blocking the aisle. On departing cabin economy passengers were allowed to depart before premium this is only a problem because premium passengers pay a lot more for this privilege so apart from more seat width and extra luggage there is no difference any more between economy and premium. The crew on this flight were dreadful. Having said this other crews have been fabulous it is a pity this is not consistent. We are flying Upper Class in a few weeks time hope we have a good crew.,3/18/2014,2,5,3,5,1,2
A Brown,0,"Auckland-Nadi and Nadi-LA return. We encountered substantial delays through the entire process which seemed to be the result of poor organization. Onboard it was hit and miss if the personal screen actually worked and some of the seating did not recline - not comfortable for a 10 hour flight. At the back of the aircraft it was hotter than the ambient Fiji air temperature when we arrived midsummer. The food was a warm unrecognizable soft slop consistency. Crew - What crew? After greeting us on the plane and serving us the two ""meals"" they pulled a disappearing act and were never seen again. The crew demeanour was disinterested and rude towards passengers.",2/3/2012,3,1,1,1,1,1
A Wolf,0,June 22/23 were 859 and 5859 from CVG to PIE. After experiencing 7 delays plus a total cancellation of our flight on June 22 this is the bottom line (according to me). Allegiant is simply unable to accommodate delays (weather/mechanical) flight crew timing out or what have you. The fleet is very small so they cannot put you on another flight like the other big carriers can nor do they have contracts with other airlines to re-book you and get you on your way. After the headaches disappointment worry and trouble I went through for my trip the savings was just not worth it. Its not to say that Delta does not experience issues they do they are just better able to accommodate and/or offer options.,7/6/2014,1,4,0,0,3,2
A Haka,1,Helsinki-Singapore return. Flights were on time return flight slightly ahead of schedule. Plane was a new and clean Airbus A340 and the crew was professional.

A Puri,1,"DEL-HEL-LHR-HEL-DEL in Business. Most flights were punctual and the onboard service was attentive and friendly with an air of efficiency. The food and wine was excellent my special meal came individually labelled with no glitches on all four sectors and the cabins were fresh and comfortable. Transfers at Helsinki were fast and efficient. The A330 from Delhi to Helsinki offered flat beds albeit with a rather strange layout that seems to be unique to Finnair - two seats in one row and one seat in the row behind with footwells extending quite deeply. The seats turn into flat beds which are tolerably comfortable but there is a distinct feeling of being cramped. At 5'10"" my feet were running up against the end of the footwell. The A320s to and from London had the standard European seating pretty much three-across economy class seats with limited legroom but with the middle seat left free. Three hours from Helsinki to London in those seats was tiring to be frank. The A340 back from Helsinki to Delhi had clearly older seats which turned into inclined beds (in a 2-2-2 layout). These were not comfortable the incline was excessive and again there was limited legroom. I slept poorly in them and was disappointed. If Finnair could do something about the seating they'd be unbeatable.",9/27/2012,5,2,4,2,5,6
A Hallatt,0,"09/09/14 VS016 from MCO 19.35 (Delayed until 21.20). I have flown with Virgin a few times and they usually a good airline to fly with (and I have written positive comments accordingly) but this last flight the attendants were completely disinterested in their customers. Such a shame to see how much the staff on this particular flight have let their company down. We were sat in the emergency exit seats and a staff member seemed more interested in using the exit door as a ""beat box"" with his hands and yawning without having the courtesy of at least putting his hand over his mouth. Our friends on the other side of the plane were served with the same amount of interest. Come on Virgin Atlantic where is the professionalism?",9/14/2014,2,2,2,5,1,6

A Brown,1,SAN-ORD-ROC and BUF-ORD-SAN. I decided to fly paid first as the cost when booking only a few weeks out was only slightly more than economy. I've flown AA first domestically many times so didn't expect much but flying so early in the morning it was nice to have a slightly larger seat to sleep. I'm only writing this review to point out what a drastic turn for the worse after the merger. The food quality while on domestic F is never great has always been better than the rest on AA. It is now absolutely disgusting. The one positive is that first is now offered on American Eagle - a very minor improvement of course for a flight so short in duration. I really hope management wakes up and realizes that they are ruining what was a much better than average airline.,1/19/2015,1,3,1,1,4,5
A Quinne,0,Poor seat quality with very thin coverings and no recline. Staff spent far too long trying to sell you products. Expensive fares and pretty inflexible on being 1kg over on luggage.

A Rahman,0,SYD to LA with my wife. On our return flight from LA the breakfast had run out and crews were forced to make some sort of pancake which was inedible. After a long night of barely any sleep we were hungry and looking forward to breakfast. We went to the US for a 3 weeks holidays and on our return flight we found the entertainment was exactly same as our outbound flight. Considering such a long flight time I think VA should consider updating their entertainment package more regularly. We found some staff were not well trained. For long flights I think more experienced staff should be considered. Overall I think VA is quite overrated based on the service that we had received.,11/30/2011,3,4,1,2,3,6
A Brydges,1,First time on the Dreamliner Premium Class nothing but praise. We went Gatwick to Sanford 17th September and returned 2nd October. Everything went smoothly no delays or hold ups our own check in and boarded and unboarded first. Little things but help when you have paid quite a lot extra to upgrade. Cabin crew on both legs were friendly and helpful food lovely (I am a vegetarian) plenty of drinks offered and entertainment was good. If possible I would only fly Premium Class again.

I flew transatlantic EWR-Zurich and LHR T2-EWR I tried outbound on a premium plus seat for 125$ add on pretty comfortable. I'm only disappointed because I did not receive my special meal as requested the air hostess asked me to confirm with United's customer service centre next time. Otherwise arrived on time clean comfortable although too cold cabin. Good entertainment. I'm giving United also a good satisfaction rate because of 100% mileage earned on my loyalty program of another Star Alliance member.,6/13/2014,4,4,2,4,3,7

A Hardig,1,One of the best low cost carriers I have taken but check-in is an absolute disaster. On both segments of my KUL-ICN flights the check-in was a mess. I printed boarding passes ahead of time on the first leg but when I arrived at LCCT the bag drop off lines were longer than the normal check-in lines and it took well over an hour with no clear indications of where to go. On the return flight from Seoul it was incompetence by the check-in staff which led to 2+ hour long waits. I arrived at the airport 3 hours early and had to run to my flight to catch it after clearing check-in security and passport control. It takes 30 seconds for me to check- in online but for some reason the check-in crew are taking 15-20 minutes per pax. Other than check-in everything else was fine.,1/5/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8

Managed to get upstairs at the last minute on BA11 (10/7). Excellent cabin crew. Couldn't have been more different than on any other sector on this trip. Interesting and interested.

A Harlow,1,Bangkok to Chiang Mai in business class. Check in at Bangkok was smooth since there were no queues. Domestic royal silk lounge is brilliant for domestic lounge. When we got to the gate for boarding the flight was suddenly delayed 15 minutes for an unknown reason. Once we finally boarded the aircraft the staff were very friendly and all of them were willing to help you with anything. Seats on the B737-400 are not very comfortable due to the hard padding the tight legroom and the footrest which takes up even more of your legroom. Apart from the wide seats and smaller cabin I honestly felt like I was sitting in economy. Once we were all settled in the purser came around offering us a choice of drinks before take off. Not long after we took off the light snack was served. On this flight the snack was Cold Teriyaki Chicken with Salad which was not very nice. Apart from these small reasons Thai is a very good airline and I will definitely be flying with them again.,9/4/2013,3,2,3,1,5,8

Eventually said I'd been put on a SQ flight at 2335, be there 4hrs before so grabbed bags and dashed. At the airport some confusion and they checked me onto an earlier flight to Chennai, uneventful but I just knew the bag would be left. It was. Horrible wait in smelly, cramped airport lounge only slightly better than an airport that smells like a WC. 2am departure on time and told bag didn't make it.

Returning 25th March 2013 the same happened but this time I was given row 25 which for me is impossible and when I told the check-in staff I was told to sort it out on the plane which I did and was told there was no seats nearer even though I could see row 4 had an empty seat.

We actually boarded only to be told that there was yet another technical fault and no part available in Portugal. Customer services have a couldn't care less attitude apparently they are waiting for a part from the UK. I know this is not an isolated incident and is pretty much a weekly event in this route. Lack of investment in an ageing fleet is very apparent.

A Hayes,1,Flew Ho Chi Minh to Frankfurt 4 Oct on Boeing 777 200 series in business class. Although seats are a little on the old side the were reasonably comfortable. The inflight entertainment system did not work and only one film offered on the main screen which is not acceptable in business class! Otherwise food and was excellent. Again no showers at Ho Chi Minh airport business class lounge.,10/7/2013,5,4,5,1,5,7
A Canella,0,"Terrible service one of the worst flights I've been on. Flew from Riga to Miami. My connecting flight was ""final call ""1 hr before takeoff. The lounge they packed us in was tiny causing most of us to have to sit on the floor. Inflight services were terrible no beverages were offered periodically instead you would have to request awkwardly. I don't mind being charged for what I eat what was terrible was that there was no real food to choose from only nachos chips peanuts and garbage food. This service was not available for large potions of the flight. At the end off the long flight I was feeling very starved. Cost of flight included nothing which makes it hard to compare with flights that do when shopping. Extra for choosing Seats no included check baggage. My bag that was 5KG over weight cost Â£185. Will never fly again.",8/6/2014,1,3,1,4,1,NaN
A Wortham,0,YVR-PDX. Check in a breeze and a small aircraft (think it was a 28 seater). Got a drink and a few snacks as well. Crew on board were fantastic and a great flight. Seats were comfy.,5/21/2007,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,5
A Richards,1,In October this year I flew AUH-HKG-AUH HM86 and HM87. Although slightly late leaving Abu Dhabi due to a catering issue the entire experience with Air Seychelles was brilliant. Although they were not particularly new A330-200 aircraft's and the entertainment system a bit old and limited I found the cabin crew quite possibly the best in the business. They were an energetic and enthusiastic crew working hard to give excellent customer service to passengers. The flights were not full on either sector so having 2 seats to myself was great and comfortable. After friendly chats about the airline with some of the crew in the galley I was brought champagne and chocolates to my seat a lovely gesture. Air Seychelles was a stark contrast to their partner airline Etihad.,10/22/2014,5,4,5,3,5,9
A Yau,0,They changed my flight schedule more than 5 times prior to the flight date. After my initial outbound flight from London Heathrow I wasn't too upset. I was actually pleasantly surprised by the hospitality and the fact that I had in-flight entertainment for both the 9-hour and 4-hour flights. However on the inbound flight back to London I was extremely disappointed with the fact that there wasn't any in-flight entertainment after being pleasantly surprised during the outbound. The connecting flight was scheduled much too early and the logistics in Beijing Airport meant that we had to be specifically rushed through. I was initially worried that my luggage would not be able to make the transfer but after the hour's delay I was hopeful! In the end my luggage got left in Beijing and after arriving on a Friday my luggage got to me on Sunday. Overall the seats were alright but not quite right either - other airlines like Qatar are better. The food was not bad but the drinks did not have enough variety. The hospitality was very good actually which was a surprise to everyone who asked!,1/25/2014,4,3,3,3,4,5
A Carleton,0,LHR-ABZ. Check-in at London was slow only one desk open for fast bag drop with around 25 people queuing. Despite this there were 6 or 7 BMI staff chatting away at the side not trying to open any of the other desks to speed up the process. Eventually one extra minion appeared but seemed to be on a go-slow. On the flight the cabin attendant was efficient if not particularly friendly. The plane was in good condition with comfortable seats and not too crowded. BMI need to improve on the check-in front before I would consider spending my own money on their flights.,5/8/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,5
A Hemann,0,Had a flight booked from Entebbe Uganda to Zanzibar via Dar es Salam. Precision Air told us late in the evening before the flight the next day they had cancelled the outbound flight and were planning to re-route us via Nairobi but a day later. Precision Air staff at the airport in Entebbe were very helpful and they did put us up in a very nice hotel. However Precision Air then also cancelled our return flight. Since we were without internet we found out when we arrived at the airport in Zanzibar that our flight had been cancelled. Sent to the Precision Air office which was closed and nobody answered on their phone. Eventually helped to get us on an alternative flight via Kilimanjaro.,5/21/2013,1,2,2,1,3,NaN
A Richardson,1,Manchester to Paphos (Titan Airways on behalf of Jet2). We were advised after booking extra legroom seats that all seats would be 28 inch pitch. I was rather concerned as I'm 6ft tall but I need not have worried. Whilst they are not the best seats in the world my knees didn't touch the seat in front. On the return leg the aircraft was far from clean with the floor littered with crisps but given the tight turnaround I suppose I shouldn't find this surprising. Both flights were on time the staff were friendly and helpful and the flight times were good. They are certainly my airline of choice for my Cyprus trips.,8/29/2013,4,4,3,NaN,4,7
A Hetier,0,MRD-CCS (domestic flight). Since Santa Barbara's old ATR-42 are the only way to fly to and from MÃ©rida it is difficult to complain. The other two companies Avior and Aserca operate much smaller planes and it is almost impossible to buy a ticket from them. But a friend of mine told me she had luggage lost and she could not get any refund or even a reply.,11/5/2008,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,3
A Carpenter,1,Flew BKK-BOM-LHR. BKK-BOM unexciting and somewhat hard-nosed female cabin crew which is a shame. Flight was on- time. 7-hour layover in Mumbai was lovely in new terminal building great food options and plenty of lounger chairs to lay-back and rest. BOM-LHR on 787 was fabulous very comfortable lots of legroom pleasant peaceful cabin except for one unfortunate air-rage incident which was handled very professionally by the cabin crew. Food a bit heavy for my liking but I would fly these guys again.,3/30/2014,4,4,2,4,4,7
A Yomi,1,"JFK-NRT JAL 005. B777-300ER - New JAL Sky Suite. Economy Class. Check in was smooth and easy at JFK. Being an AA Platinum Elite member (Sapphire leveling on One World carriers) it means an extension of preferred benefits network wide. What JAL does differently though is that it immediately includes Priority Boarding status and lounge access indication on your ticket which I found helpful and convenient. A bit of a slight negative in my praise if ever so little is that the lounge at JFK has seen better days and could use some sprucing up. I must say this was one of the most pleasurable flight experiences I've had in a long time having flown so far (14 hrs straight) and in economy class. What's impressive about what JAL's done is design a standard economy seat with comfort and practicality foremost. With a pitch of 34"" this has got to be one of the most generous legrooms in coach period. JAL takes Premium Economy to the next level with a whopping 42"" and a whole slew of other amenities. Meal service was also a big plus. Two full meals and a mid-flight snack were served. The initial meal after takeoff comprised of two different types of appetizers fruit salad slaw salad and your choice of entree. Very scrumptious. The meal on my return journey on a different airline Cathay Pacific was a scant offering by comparison. Inflight entertainment was fairly good though lacking a little in the variety of English language TV shows. Movies were excellent - several recently released Oscar nominated flicks were on feature. Also really enjoyed the cabin crew they were all very gracious and accommodating. Overall a very pleasurable experience.",3/24/2014,4,5,5,4,5,9
A Ritzau,1,Caught the Dubai to Adelaide 300-777 Sept 18 2014. After the A380 experience this was definitely a louder bumpier ride! Seats were smaller and more cramped. People had far to much cabin baggage which really annoyed me on this flight as it was us who had stuck to the rules of 7kg limit 1 bag who had to separate our luggage and have it stashed all over the plane. I feel this should be policed by the terminal staff. Our luggage was only ever weighed leaving Adelaide airport. The people in front reclined their seats fully for the whole trip and they were not asked to sit upright when we were trying to eat which had happened on other recent flights. The galley was very noisy especially in down time when the passengers where trying to sleep. The toilets were very noisy when flushed and although we were seated away from the toilet we still constantly got woken by them. Ambience was lovely. Plane was clean and fresh looking although a little worn around the edges. Food was tasty and a lot of it. Drinks were regular but cold drinks were warm. Seemed a common problem on all our flights. Staff were friendly and attentive just loud. My entertainment screen was broken and wouldn't work by touch once I worked out the hand set this was ok. The audio was broken and static I had to listen to one ear input only! This was a shame as the other experiences I had were great and despite this I would still fly Emirates and recommend them to friends.,10/1/2014,5,3,5,5,5,6
A Casey,0,TG949 Madrid to Bangkok. On Oct 6th T Hawk submitted a complaint about the very poor seat he had in business class. Five days later on 11th Oct I had the same experience in seat 12J on the same flight from Madrid to Bangkok. When I tried to register a complaint in Bangkok a) at the ticket desk b) at the business class lounge they were simply not interested. The other 3 legs I travelled were good.,10/28/2014,2,1,3,3,3,5
A Rivers,1,Flew from New York to Narita last month - seat was comfortable food was good really at par with the best airlines. JAL flight crew is the best and this was one of the best flight experiences I had because of the crew.,12/29/2014,3,4,5,4,5,9
A Yong,1,BHX-ZRH-SIN on a Fokker 100 followed by an A340-300. Both aircraft's were clearly quite old but very well kept. This was my first time using solely mobile boarding passes on my phone for the entire journey and the check-in and boarding experience was flawless. Check-in desk at Birmingham was kind enough to allow my bag which was almost 2kg over the limit which I was not expecting from a European airline. Zurich airport is definitely a selling point for choosing Swiss stylish easy to navigate and very efficient. Swiss also has probably the best-timed schedules for connecting flights between Europe and Asia. Overall service and hospitality onboard both flights was friendly and attentive almost as good as Asian carriers. Can't say the same about the catering which was rather basic (cold sandwich on a 2 hour full-service international flight is unheard of in Asia no menus offered meal portions intercontinental were on the small side). Upsides were the surprisingly good wine available and the delicious Swiss cheese. The Y seat on the A340 is okay but rather outdated with no in-seat power or foot rest and an annoyingly large IFE box under the window seat. No amenity kits whatsoever on a 12 hour flight but the frequent drinks service was appreciated. Overall a rather average inflight experience for the premium price Swiss typically charges sweetened by the excellent experience on the ground.,3/3/2014,3,3,3,2,4,7
A Hickling,1,LHR-PHL on a 787 Dreamliner seat 3K. I recommend seats 3K 3A 7A and 7K as you get aisle access and no other passengers have to climb over your feet when they leave their seat. The seat does feel a little claustrophobic compared to the upper deck of the 747 but it's very comfortable. The service was outstanding provided by an all male crew. The food quality has improved and so has the menu choices. The entertainment system is excellent as it's the Thales version on the 787 so the screens are bigger and the picture quality is better. The aircraft is also very quiet and the windows are a gimmick as you dim the windows rather than using the conventional blind.,9/6/2014,5,4,5,5,5,9
A Cervov,1,Our first flight with Wizzair from Skopje to Memmingen and all was correct there was no delay. Food was just for sale but for a normal Price. Flight staff were very friendly. We can recommend.,2/8/2013,4,3,3,5,5,10
A Robertson,1,Guayaquil to Galapagos (Balta) coach. Flight was delayed several hours (which appeared to be preplanned because our guide knew about it). When the flight arrived it was a new 757 and they served breakfast/lunch. All flight attendants spoke clear English and very helpful.,7/19/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Chalmers,1,First time we have used Jet2 holidays and we were very happy with the services provided from start to finish. Check in was very easy at Glasgow Airport the vouchers were self explanatory and easy to print off the staff were very friendly at check in and on the flight and at the resort. The leg room on the flight was brilliant and we didn't have to pay extra as this is the norm on the Jet2 planes. We also got 22kg of luggage allowance per person which is fantastic but even better than that if there are 4 people on your booking the combined allowance is 88kg which can be distributed over 4 cases. On the flight the price of food and drink is also very reasonable. Will definitely be using Jet2 in the future.,6/11/2013,5,5,5,NaN,5,10
A Hicks,1,On a recent trip from Stuttgart to Stansted I had the window seat in a row which was also occupied by a young mother and her four or five year old daughter. The minor took the seat next to me. Once we had achieved cruising altitude the mother produced an iPad from her bag and placed it on the table in front of the child. Then without the slightest consideration for their fellow passengers a Mickey Mouse movie was run with the soundtrack coming to all in earshot over the speakers. Since it was a reasonably short flight I plugged my own headphones in a did my best to ignore the cartoon. Now that such technology is available I think it might be high time for Germanwings to regulate such behavior. Obviously a sense of social responsibility is no longer sufficient. Germanwings usually provides a decent service it would be a shame if they allow selfishly ignorant passengers to spoil it.,12/18/2012,4,3,2,0,4,5
A Robinson,0,I took a 5 hour flight from Dulles to Vegas. I wasn't sitting with my boyfriend who I booked the flight with. We were delayed nearly 2 hours. The seats were like sitting on a rock and my seat recline was broken. To watch TV was 5.99 to get a soda was 2.99! On the way home we got to sit together but there weren't any TVs and none of the seats reclined. The flight home boarded a hour early and took off early which those of us who were there appreciated but a lot of people got left behind. I will go back to flying with Delta!,4/17/2015,2,1,1,1,3,2
A Yu,0,LA to Vancouver in premium economy. Due to a hand injury I asked a flight attendant to assist me with lifting my carry-on luggage to the overhead bin. The flight attendant was unwilling to help and replied that she also had a hand injury. When I asked her again she offered to check my luggage. I declined her offered and explain that my luggage is not heavy but due to a hand injury I have limited range of hand motion and showed her the hand with the hand brace on. She replied again that she also had a hand injury and just stood there. It wasn't until I asked her for another flight attendant to help me that she suggested that we put the luggage up together. I was polite and respectful throughout the entire conversation was surprised at the level of service I was receiving. I will not fly with them again.,8/1/2013,2,2,0,2,1,1
A Chandy,1,There are two versions of Ethiopian Airlines. Version A is a dilapidated one with frayed edges and a cabin crew to match. Version B is an ultra modern one flying Dreamliners. I had the opportunity to try both versions on my recent flight from Kuwait to Johannesburg. The first leg KWI-ADD was Version A and the second leg ADD-JNB was Version B. The two versions compete favourably for the top positions on either end of the spectrum of airlines servicing the African Continent.,6/25/2013,3,3,3,3,3,5
A Rochard,0,YYZ-BRU in economy. Plane was on time facilities were ok staff were hard to find outside service times. The absolute worst thing about the experience were the other passengers. They all seemed to be high-maintenance passengers: really elderly people and many bawling and screaming infants. The children did not stop screaming all the way to and from Brussels. I would have expected this on a low cost charter airline but this took me by surprise. Of course the staff did little or nothing to help keep things calm you just had to grin and bear it or spend the $500 for an upgrade to Premiere class.,4/29/2014,3,3,3,3,2,4
A Zakaria,1,Supposed to fly: AKL-SYD-ICN-LHR-VCE (AKL-SYD with QF LHR-VCE with BA) on 8th Dec 2012 but was re- routed to CDG. Cons: Firstly my flight was delayed in Sydney due to late arrival of aircraft from Incheon because of heavy snow. Secondly Both legs were using old aircraft's and the worst is that the entertainment system (AVOD) was horrible with a lack of choice and unable to restart the movie from the beginning. I was only told that my flight to London was cancelled when I arrived at ICN. Pros: They re-routed me to CDG when my flight was cancelled to LHR. They took responsibility of the whole journey even though the LHR-VCE part was booked separately from Asiana. Ground staffs in ICN were excellent friendly and tried their best to accommodate me.,2/22/2013,3,4,3,1,5,7
A Hijmans,1,SSA-GRU-SSA in Economy. Outbound flight rescheduled but I was contacted by telephone the previous day. Airbus A320 outbound A321 inbound both planes clean but interior worn.

A Chappell,1,Sydney to Amsterdam via Guangzhou. Almost 800 dollars cheaper than the nearest competitor so can't complain on price. New PTV's were a nice surprise as I had been told there were going to be none. Food ok. Seat on the A330-300 had plenty of leg room so good for me as I'm 6'5. A330-200 leg room not as good but the same as most other airlines. Two biggest takeaways were poor English language skills from flight attendants and being served a glass of black tea with no milk. Strange. But they were on time got me there safely and weren't all that bad for the price. Would go again if was significantly cheaper but not my preferred airline.,6/19/2013,5,3,2,3,2,6
A Rogers,0,"I was traveling alone with two children and was told I would board with the A group. Every plane was delayed. Then my returning flights home were delayed. No one could tell me why there were all these delays. Southwest is terrible all around. Then I get on my flight to Rochester only for the flight attendant to say there is no WiFi onboard. My flight was supposed to leave at 10.20pm than changed to 11.35, and I'm still sitting here after midnight.",7/15/2015,3,2,1,NaN,2,3
A Zich,0,I assumed Spirit airlines was a traditional airline since I booked the tickets like I book all my tickets and there were no notifications of additional expenses or the non-traditional business model. Now that I know more about the model I think they may be onto something but not informing customers that the seats are cramped especially on longer flights and that you need to pay for all baggage is poor business practice. I actually paid more for this flight with the baggage fees than I would have for a major US airline. In other words I actually paid more for less comfort no entertainment and a poor experience. This was once of my poorest flight experiences to date - this is based primarily on comfort and the fact that I felt duped. If Spirit had been up front with their business model I likely would have a different opinion. Businesses like this are made on repeat customers not a continuous stream of first time customers. Good business model if you really can provide seats for cheaper (mine wasn't cheaper) but poor execution. I will not be a repeat customer.,1/11/2015,1,1,1,1,2,2
A Hills,1,Just returned from Cuba. Very worried about flying with Thomas Cook due to poor reviews but was very pleasantly surprised outbound and inbound flights both on time returning we were 2 hours faster. We booked bulkhead seats which were worth the money although seats slightly narrow the food was excellent both ways hot and tasty. The plane was clean and tidy and the staff were attentive and friendly. No concerns about using them again.,4/22/2013,5,4,5,3,5,8
A Chater,1,LHR-KEF-BOS return. Checked in online for all flights which worked well with the advance seat selection under the 'My Booking' page on the Icelandair website. Check-in queues were all very short and all flights departed on time. Inflight entertainment system is on par with other major airlines and certainly better than what many US airlines offer on similar flights. Food is buy on board but as we already knew this we made other arrangements. Connection in Iceland carried out with ease only criticism is that boarding in Keflavik is rather disorganised several flights leave at the same time from one corridor and announcements are not made for any of the flights making it difficult to identify which queue is for which gate/flight. That said I would definitely fly Icelandair again as these flights seem to break up what can be a long transatlantic journey.,8/15/2013,5,4,4,5,5,9
A Ross,1,YYZ-YVR-YYZ this past week enjoyable flights both ways. I am finding myself flying a lot on the 777. The leg room on this plane is great. On my return flight yesterday the airline had to make a last minute aircraft change and we flew home on the 767. This change was handled in a very professional manner. The counter employees were quick to re-assign seats and tried their best to accommodate every ones request. I have flown Air Canada twice in the last 2 months and have had an enjoyable experience both times. People need to realize that we are no longer in the Wardair days and that Air Canada is doing the best they can.,5/15/2014,5,5,4,4,5,8
A Chen,0,Flew from JFK to Beijing supposed to return from MNL back to JFK on July 23. Food was so-so nothing to write home about attendants appeared to have problems with food carts and would push and pull without looking to see that the cart would be banging into passengers' shoulders. In MNL flights were cancelled rebooked cancelled without explanation. No ground crew or call centres to respond to inquiries. Finally rebooked back to JFK on Delta one day later. Communications totally inadequate not acceptable.,8/14/2012,1,1,1,1,2,1
A Hlls,1,"Just back from Cuba. I do not understand what people expect I know you have to buy drinks but on other airlines where they are ""free"" the price will be added onto to the fare price at least this way you have the choice whether to spend your money or not. Food was very edible we booked exit door seats no problems from this end but arrived at Holguin airport for return flight and found our booked seats had been sold. Very quickly sorted out and we got our seats staff worked very hard and were pleasant. This is second time with TC and have not been disappointed on either occasion.",4/30/2014,5,3,4,2,5,9
A. Hansen,1,OSL-CPH return. Ticket would have been quite expensive on this trip but fortunately I had enough bonus points to get a free ticket. Either way SAS` tickets were twice as expensive so no choice really. Used the self check-in machine on both OSL and CPH and had checked in and gone through security in no time. On the flight down to Copenhagen we flew on a new 737-800 which was spotless. Cabin crew was nice and friendly. The flight back was not so positive - a 20 minutes delay. Our plane was an older 737-300 and it showed signs of age. However the seats were new comfortable leather seats - not as clean either. The crew explained that they had chosen to try to have a short turn-around as possible and I guess that makes sense. Crew not as pleasant on this return flight but all in all it was a satisfactory experience and I almost always prefer Norwegian over SAS.,2/27/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,7
A Rowe,0,Given the quality and variety of Italian food beer and wine and Italian hospitality in general its surprising that the Italian 'National Carrier' steadfastly refuses to showcase anything positive about its home and culture. On any airline the quality of the crew is all important. I have persevered with Alitalia but no more. Crew do not assist with the boarding process hence it takes far too long to get passengers seated and flights are often delayed as a result. Once onboard service will not commence for 30 mins after departure. Nothing is available for sale (another opportunity missed). If Alitalia is to survive all of this needs to changed.,12/1/2014,1,3,1,0,1,2
A Chinnery,1,Travelled 24/8/14 FR8747. The return to Stansted on Ryanair from La Rochelle was ok. The experience at La Rochelle was ok and the inbound flight arrived 15 mins early. Boarding began at 10 for our 10.30 flight. The doors where shut at 10.30 and the safety demonstration was played in English and then French. We were off around 10.35 just 5 mins behind schedule. The inflight service began with drinks and snacks. I had a pepsi which was in a small can. Then the duty free service before rubbish during our decent over London. We landed just before 10.45 10 mins early. Yet again no fanfare but a little announcement about there low fares and the fact they have a 90% punctuality record. Overall they just get you there on time which is really all that travel is so I would recommend them if you are on a budget or Stansted is your local airport.,8/28/2014,4,2,2,NaN,2,7
A Hoffmann,0,6 May 2014 MH 388 to Shanghai Pudong. What is going in with Malaysian airlines? Service seems to have taken a dive together with food quality. Revamped First class lounge in KL is worse than the noodle cafe outside. Removing the platinum lounge to make way for that not so good. Also what's with the entertainment onboard? Please change it around faster. Having the same TV and movies running for months is not cool. Been flying MAS for 10 years and platinum member for 3. So I have seen the decline.,5/8/2014,2,2,2,1,3,3
Aagar Sambasivan,1,Sanah to Mumbai on A330. A full flight but the crew were efficient polite and with passable English. I had window seat 30A and the legroom was just fine. Food was good but a little dry. Inflight entertainment not very exciting some Arabic drama without subtitles. Announcements from cockpit were clear and kept passengers updated. The negative is the awkward timings of the flight which arrives in Mumbai at 4 in the morning.,8/11/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,5
Aaron Chia,1,I took flight EK405 from Melbourne to Singapore. My Flight was at 1800 and it departed on time. The cabin crew were very helpful and its customer service was great. The personal television was big and there was a great choice of movies. The cabin lighting was great too. I took the B777-300ER and the seating arrangement was 3-4-3. It was rather cramped but the overall experience was great and I would recommend and definitely take Emirates again.,6/5/2014,4,4,4,5,4,9
A Rueckert,1,ORY-KUL-PER MEL-KUL-ORY. You exactly get what you pay for. We were aware of that so the experience was overall positive. The only thing that seems unnecessary is that you have to collect your bags in KUL check them in again a couple of minutes later. Overall the flights were uneventful. AirAsia X offers a very cheap option to Australia (less than 700 EUR return).,3/6/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
Aaron Eisenberg,1,Sydney to Nadi June 7th on the brand new A330-200 (first time in use from SYD). What can I say they overtaken any European or US airline even Qantas (which code-share on these flights). Specious seats best legroom a full service airline can offer. Food was surprisingly very good. Free alcoholic beverages. Personal IFE on demand with the latest movies. A quick and good service. Always with a smile. I ask for vegi meal on board and immediately after take off received one. It seems they have made 180 degrees change for their new branding. I flew a lot with many airlines around the world and I'm not easily giving away complements. Except for the screaming Aussie kids which really not the airline fault the all experience was very good. Nadi to Sydney on 737-800. Not with personal IFE but again specious seats good service and food and landing on time. Incomparable to the no frills Virgin Australia or Jetstar.,6/11/2013,4,4,5,4,5,9
A Hong,0,"HX529 September 12 2013. Booked Hanoi - Hong Kong. On the departure day we had no idea the flight was cancelled no communication from the airline whatsoever. We had to call the airline to see that the flight was indeed cancelled since the airline website was utterly useless and they tried to have us fly the next day which was unacceptable to us. We asked them to put us on the Cathay Pacific flight on the same day and they said they would call us back. A few hours went by and no word so we called them back. The woman on the phone had the audacity to say we had contacted them a few days ago to try to cancel our flight and get a refund which was a lie. Eventually they got us on the Cathay flight. This was a classic case of ""you get what you pay for"". We booked with Hong Kong Airlines to save some money but will do so again we will rather spend the extra money for less stress and better service with other airlines such as Cathay.",9/15/2013,1,0,0,0,1,NaN
A Chinnery,1,LGW-UVF 25 May. UVF-LGW 2/3 June. Arrived 3 hours and 45 mins before 10.00 departure. Bag drop was ok. Several free upper class check in agents and 1 occupied economy agent. We where told to drop of bags at upper class. A quite nice start. Boarding began 78 mins before departure. We where on GWAG an A330. LGW-UVF only. We left (airborne) at 09.54 6 mins early. GWAG has no remotes. So IFE whilst good has got room for improvement on this aircraft. Meals where OK. Movie treat nice and drinks where served 3 times (improved over 2-3 years ago). We landed 30 mins early and beat the BA (777) and the AA (JFK757) so we got though immigration OK. On the way back a bit worse in some cases. Check in 2 hours 50 mins before flight. Quick and easy. We where late by 1 hour (not as bad as Orlando when we where delayed 1 hour in Tarmac). Boarding began 25 mins before we where airborne and we were off quickly. This aircraft GVGEM was operating VS90 from GND-UVF-LGW. GVGEM has got remotes and IFS was better. We landed 50mjns early and the arrival was uneventful. I didn't have meals as I ate at airport.,7/13/2014,3,3,4,4,3,7
A Ryall,0,Air France is Europe's worst national airline for long haul. Cityjet seem to take their role of supporting their parent seriously and clearly share the same values and customer care policies - they don't have any. On a BA flight this morning after the cancellation of my Cityjet flight last nigh and what a contrast - Air France provided one agent to re-book 90 passengers and result was a 2 hour queue. They told us nothing about the problem and ignored the problems of passengers.,10/11/2012,1,3,1,0,1,1
Aaron Gimmeson,0,Flying round trip from Columbus OH to Las Vegas through Detroit. Jan 3-6 2014. Delta gate agents are rude and abrupt. They were late getting me to my connection in DTW due to computer problems during boarding at the gate in Columbus. I made it to the gate in DTW 12 min before departure but the agent had given away my seat and said sternly that it was to late and to go complain at gate A43. I did and they told me to call customer service. I did that and they said they cant do anything because I need to talk to a gate agent. They gave me the run around and really did not care. Flying home was more mechanical problems. I wound up having to sleep in DTW airport. No hotels available. When I boarded flight DL6121 the agent was slow. I fly for work and will no longer fly Delta. The ground crew and flight crew were all great and concerned for the safety of the passengers. The gate agents lack any general concern for customers safety comfort or well being.,1/9/2014,0,2,4,1,4,NaN
A Howarth,1,Manchester to Murcia return 15th - 22nd July 2013. I travel very regularly to Spain and I am always very happy with my Ryanair flights. People who moan about such things as size of bags etc annoy me - all the requirements are made very clear at booking. If you don't like it don't book - and probably pay a lot more!,9/4/2013,5,5,4,NaN,5,10
A Chitre,1,BDQ-HYD via BOM. The check-in at Vadodara was smooth though they did not give me through check in to Hyderabad. I had to claim my luggage and re-check in at Mumbai but it was smooth. Ground staff courteous and efficient. Aircraft clean cabin crew efficient and courteous. Boarding at Mumbai was chaotic. Overall not bad at all.,6/8/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Sabaratnam,0,The service offered by Jet Airways is very disappointing I was taking a domestic flight from Bengaluru to Kolkata on 18 December 2013. When I checked-in I was told my luggage had exceeded the limit of 15kg. While I understand that such limits are imposed on domestic flights but for someone who is on a long business trip in India who has been allowed up to 20kg or 30kg on international flights how do the authorities expect us to shed off excess weight when flying from one city to the next within India? I was asked to pay for the exceeded amount at a Jet Airways counter. When I went to the counter the service was extremely slow. The counter staff were more interested in attending to the sale of tickets. Onboard there is lack of discipline by staff. People were still talking on their phone after the announcement was made not to do so. This is the second time I have flown on Jet Airways. Their lack of interest in the well being of the passengers is worrying. I will never fly Jet Airways again if I can help it.,12/29/2013,3,3,1,1,1,2
A Huggett,1,Rome to Sydney via Dubai. First time with Emirates courtesy of a QF code-share. Both flights on A380 aircraft. I enjoyed the opportunity to sit at the front of the lower deck as economy uses the entire deck. IFE is class- leading and food and drink (including a pre-dinner drink service) was great. Seat pitch was very good as were the crew. I would be very happy to fly Emirates again.,9/17/2014,4,5,5,5,5,10
A Christie,0,We travelled to Cancun on 3rd January 2013. Flight took a couple of hours longer due to headwind which made an uncomfortable flight even more unpleasant. The seat I had pre-booked at extra cost would not fully recline so sleeping for part of the journey to recover from an early start was impossible. The inflight entertainment is limited you are encouraged to pay an extra Â£10 to be able to watch films at a time convenient to you. The inflight food is meagre. If you want water it is to be paid for. On long haul flights surely this should be free. Inflight staff spend most of their time selling food and drink and other payable options. After spending 8 hours on this flight we were then told that we would have to complete customs immigrations forms for Mexican customs but they didn't have any on board. Later we were told that someone would bring them out to the plane when we landed and given to us on debarkation. However they had run out/ We were then told we could get them in the customs hall. Arrived in the customs area to overcrowded chaos. They managed to locate some forms for us and we then had to try to complete them whilst we were walking in the queue. Another passenger in the queue told us they had the same trouble last year! I always considered Thomson to be a good company to book with. Not anymore.,2/18/2013,2,2,1,1,3,1
Aaron Hodges,0,"Single handedly the worst airline I have flown with. First airline I have encountered where you have to go to the International Terminal to check in for a Domestic flight (with no warning or anything in any of the three emails sent prior to the flight). As a result I missed the check in time for baggage, despite arriving at the airport the 1.5 hours prior to the flight that they recommend. Were unable to check me in, and charged $75 to change my flight to the next one, which wasnt for a full 24 hours.",7/22/2015,1,2,NaN,1,2,1
A Sahni,1,Flew Economy class from JFK to Moscow and then onwards from Moscow to Delhi. The aircraft's are new with rear entertainment in each seat. Food is excellent on the JFK to Moscow flight but down hill from Moscow to Delhi. Service on Aeroflot on all segments is very slow after meal service for food trays to be picked up but good rounds of drinks are provided along side coffee and tea after the meal service.,5/17/2012,5,4,4,4,4,8
A Huggett,1,"QF1 Sydney to London on August 23. A380 in good clean condition. Seats comfortable with good footrest/net that compensated a little for the 31"" seat pitch. Not exactly class-leading for long-haul. Food and drink service was fine. Crew were efficient and friendly. IFE was good. In all it was a pleasant flight on a great quiet aircraft. I had not travelled long-haul with Qantas for some years and while there was nothing particularly wrong with the flight my journey home was QF-ticketed but operated by an Emirates A380. Their little extras highlighted that QF international is not the benchmark.",9/17/2014,4,4,4,4,4,8
A Christopher,0,Definitely not for families as you will have to be seated separately throughout the plane. The initial airfare is low until you pay the extra fees for earlier check-in times so you get a chance to sit together. I checked in 2 hours early sat in the back seat where the cabin narrows very uncomfortable and my family was spread throughout the plane. To my surprise flight attendants got up after sitting in passenger allocated seating after everyone had boarded and joked about empty seats! This airline is a nightmare! However if you are traveling alone and can check in at least a week early and are comfortable with pushing shoving and being rude then maybe this airline is for you.,8/22/2013,1,1,1,NaN,1,NaN
Aase Ford,1,"I have relatives in the North of Norway and have flown to Tromsoe/Harstad many times. Three times I have flown Norwegian to Tromsoe and every time my luggage has had to be sent after me on a later aircraft than the one I have been booked on. The turnaround time in Oslo is too short, and staff in Oslo appeared to be very used to this happening. When I booked the flight for 7th July I specifically asked about this and was assured that it would be ok. The delayed luggage is extremely inconvenient, and has created difficulties for myself and my family.",7/21/2015,4,2,NaN,NaN,3,6
A Salcedo,0,5 hour delay coming from Miami Fl to Denver Co on June 2nd 2015. No complementary anything was offered. Worst planes. Now the seats are very small the tray in front of you only hold 2 cups. My last time flying with Frontier.,6/4/2015,3,1,1,1,1,NaN
A Humphries,0,Flew TCX 148 on an A330 Manchester to Cancun on 21/1/14. Paid the 'Premium upgrade' not knowing that Thomas Cook had transformed themselves into an absolutely 'no frills' carrier! Everything was extra from headphones to tea coffee soft drinks water and of course alcohol! The meal was overheated and dry with a small tea or coffee included although no offer of a second cup. If I were James Martin I wouldn't want my name printed all over the food cartons! Cabin staff were unwelcoming and quite surly once we informed them of out dissatisfaction and disappointment when we compared the 'upgrade' to that offered by Thomson on the same route previously. One replied 'well you're not flying with Thomsom now'. Shall not fly with Thomas Cook again and would not recommend to anyone else on the basis of my experience. It's the first time I've ever been hungry and thirsty on a long haul flight. Not looking forward to the return flight.,2/3/2014,1,3,1,1,1,NaN
A Chun,0,I flew from DFW to Seattle then on to Honolulu. Interior of the planes are shabby and worn. Seats are hard and narrow with minimum recline. No pillows blankets or footrests. FA tossed a bag of mixed nuts toward my hubby by the window seat couldn't she have handed it to him?,12/20/2012,0,2,3,2,2,3
A Sambasivam,1,Flew Toronto to Gatwick January 24 return on 31 January. Both ways very good flight. Outbound aircraft had the mood lights that's the plus point. My reading light was on all the way so the crew offer me an eye shade. Food and entertainment ok for 6 plus hours. Return same as excellent crew offered extra food and soft drinks. Value for the money paid only $640.,2/4/2013,4,4,3,4,4,8
Abas Sayilov,1,Istanbul - Tunisia return. Both flights comfortable and on time with reasonable leg room. Having the seat-back screen and the movie playing right up to touchdown on the return flight was something new for us on this airline. The food as is usual with Turkish was very good and the service was good too although I wish they'd relax and be a bit more smiley. My husband needed a wheelchair with very little notice and they and both airports coped very efficiently and with kindness.,11/14/2013,5,5,5,5,5,10
A Chung,1,LAX-MEL - B787-8 - Overall a good flight. Equipment changed from a B787-9 to a B787-8. Not too disappointed since it was still a Dreamliner but the change to the smaller aircraft had the consequence that a baby was moved from the forward business class to the 3 Business rows in the mid-section. A baby on 16 hrs flight - not recommended. Flight departed from LAX 1.5 hr late. Basically waited on board for 1.5 hrs. Everyone had already boarded so we were in this plane for at least 17 hrs. Flight uneventful new Dreamliner is a really great airplane large windows very airy cabin. Seat is good except that not every seat has direct aisle access. Inflight Entertainment great good selection of movies TV shows. Service was attentive (above usual United average) Food was decent. Unfortunately United does not supply their Business customers with Fast passes for Melbourne Airport Immigration so waited almost 1 hr to get through on top of the 1.5 hr delay. All in all a great plane and can recommend if you are traveling to Melbourne.,1/23/2015,4,4,4,4,4,7
A Hutton,0,London and back in Oct 2012. I wish now I had read the reviews here first otherwise we would not have flow Air Mauritius. I agree with all the other reviews no leg room entertainment box in way of feet the worst food I have had on any flight. My daughter and wife did not eat any of the meals on the outward and return flight.,10/29/2012,1,1,1,3,2,1
A Santiago,1,PHX-SEA and back. The crew signed my Alaska Airlines history book they all chatted with me and seemed in good spirits. The flight was handled smoothly and the drinks and food was generous considering what we got was being offered free (sandwiches however cost 6 dollars on economy class).,7/12/2014,5,4,5,0,5,10
Abbi Osbiston,1,JNB-LHR on the new airbus. Seats were roomy and comfy staff polite and friendly and inflight entertainment system outstanding. We had terrible turbulence throughout the flight but the captain was informative and reassuring and everyone remained calm. Food not great but otherwise excellent.,1/26/2012,4,5,3,5,4,8
A Ihao,0,HAJ-LHR ERJ 145 - Flight was half empty maybe 15 people for 45 seats! Nice clean cabin but old leather seats. Only 1 cabin crew who was nice and helpful. No free bar service like other LH/BA/IB group carriers. Value for money is very low if not absent. I would like to see BA takeover this route and make it more profitable however its highly unlikely. HAJ is a very efficient airport with good stores in the building. Would not recommend BMI at all considering their very high fares on European destinations.,4/30/2012,2,3,1,1,3,4
Abd Aziz Muhamad Pidaus,1,KUL to Manila. MH705 11 May. Cabin crew were friendly and polite. Seat was clean and neat. Announcements clear and landing was on time.,6/6/2015,5,5,5,5,5,10
A Saraiva,1,I flew London/Dubai and return via Doha in economy class. All 4 legs were on-time or even early! Apart from the Doha/Dubai leg the other flights were only half full so people could spread out and have the centre 4 seats to sleep. However I really would not say it is a five star service! The meals were OK nothing special and the portions not that large. The inflight entertainment was very good in my opinion. No amenity kits with socks or eyeshades for a 6 hr flight! On all 4 legs I found the crews very well groomed professional but not exactly warm and friendly.,12/10/2014,3,3,3,5,3,5
A Cianetti,0,FCO-CMB and CMB-FCO. I didn't understand why in the middle of night flight I was awakened (like all other passengers) to eat the second meal 3 hours and 45 minutes before landing while all the passenger resting and sleeping. After that they started selling duty-free items and only 1 hour and 45 minutes before landing they switched off the lights.,12/30/2012,3,2,3,3,1,4
AbdelRahman Emad,1,Flew on their B777-300ER for a short trip to DMM. Aircraft was far more comfortable than the older 777-300s. IFE was pretty much best in class however I did not find their meals particularly great. Decent airline overall but definitely slightly over hyped.,1/19/2015,4,4,3,5,4,8
A Ciotti,0,"My family and I flew from PHL to Rome Italy. Our 2 year old son has a severe peanut allergy. I called in advance to ask if I could board early to clean his seat and if they could make an announcement regarding the allergy. I do not expect anyone to change their eating habits we just wanted to make those immediately around us aware. I was told on the phone it is up to the individual crew the day of our flight. When we boarded the plane I asked a member of the crew. She said she would check. As I was seated a flight attendant came up to me and said in a condescending tone ""It is our policy that we do not make any exceptions for those with food allergies. We cannot guarantee anything and we do not make announcements. We do not serve peanuts but other people can eat what they want."" We just informed the people directly around us and they were more than understanding. The staff were just rude in general. My mother-in-law got up to get something that fell on the floor for my daughter. The flight attendant barked at her to move. She said ""Move we are coming through with the cart."" Where is common courtesy? When they came around with the beverage cart they merely said ""Drink""? At first we gave the airline the benefit of the doubt thinking it was only this crew. On our return to PHL the crew was worse. We didn't ask them to make an announcement as we knew the response would be the same. We did however inform the flight attendant of our son's allergy. During the flight I came out of the bathroom to notice that a woman was dipping her pretzels in peanut butter. I calmly asked the flight attendant if I could move away because of the peanut butter. She looked at me and said ""What do you want me to do""? I said ""I cannot stand here with him for long."" She scoffed and said facetiously to her partner "" We need to move because this kid has an allergy."" I should also note that the company said it does not serve peanuts or peanut products on the plane: however the pretzels handed to everyone were from ""King Nuts."" The package clearly stated that it may contain traces of peanuts and tree nuts. Clearly US Airways does not recognize the severity of the allergy.",7/29/2014,1,2,1,3,1,NaN
A Ismail,1,LHR-KUL return on A380. Checked in was fast and hassle free especially in Kuala Lumpur. Was very surprised at the service in Economy Class. I travelled long hauls about 10x a year with various airlines (mostly Etihad). Crew were very efficient serving meals within 40 minutes of take off in a full cabin! However surprised by lack of choice. Plastic cutlery which is not very premium like. Plenty of drinks and crew answers call very fast indeed. Despite a busy flight the lavatories were cleaned frequently. The most by any airlines I've flown with so far. The crew were hard working and professional smiling and they interacted well with passengers. Its the small details that makes this crew the best I've flown with. Some might not like it but at least doesn't feel robotic. TV screens were big and selection of movies were good enough. Headsets were ok. Definitely the highlight is the crew not even the A380 size could beat it. If only the prices were more affordable and the Frequent Flyer programme were better I'd be using this at least 3x a year!,4/13/2014,4,5,5,4,5,9
Abdul Hamid Jacob-Hassan,1,Flight was half empty. Crew were cordial and food was served immediately. The light-changing windows were slightly annoying. Prefer Jet for short-haul and domestic routes.,7/23/2015,3,4,2,2,3,4
Abdullah Basfar,1,KUL-JED-KUL MH150 and MH151. It was a fantastic trip for me and my family. The cabin crew were very friendly and attentive. The food were delicious. The IFE also very good with many choices of movies. I will definitely fly with Malaysia Airlines again in the future.,9/28/2014,5,5,5,5,5,10
A J Bastien,1,IST to AYT (Antalya) on October 12 2012. One-hour flight. Clean aircraft no fee for checked or carry on luggage. Complimentary sandwich and beverage. Competent and courteous FAs. Seat in front of me did not have a pocket in which to store my paperback and case for glasses. Good value for a one hour flight I will fly Atlas Jet again.,10/19/2012,4,2,3,0,4,9
Abe Ayo,0,No blankets provided until an 1hr into the flight staff were rude and blanket tossed at us without any form of gesture. No headsets throughout the duration of the flight expected to be staring at the screen without being able to listen. Over 3 toilets were out of service and toilets functioning were in a horrible state. When we pressed the call bell cabin crews ignored them for close to an hour. Return flight delayed 3 hours in Lagos. TV screens were not working and again no headsets. We kept complaining to cabin crew who reset the TV however never came back to check if it had started working. Again 2 of the toilets were also out of order. I believe this will be the last time I fly ARIK that is how bad a service myself and my wife received on our recent trip to Lagos Nigeria and back to London UK.,4/26/2012,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A J McDonald,1,Traveled from Auckland to Port Vila. Requested seats in row 3 and the request was confirmed at time of check in. Seats are good with plenty of leg and the TV. Cabin crew were a little bit on the grumpy side. The food was nice although they didn't have the requested vegetarian meal I ordered. Seats were comfortable. Landing into Port Vila is a very fast one but the views on approach are excellent. Can't complain much because we arrived 25 minutes early.,1/4/2013,4,4,5,3,3,8
Abi Nader Roland,0,Dubai - Muscat flight delayed 4 hours with no explanation. The crew on board seem they want to complete a task given to them so they are not ready to answer your request. I asked for a glass of water they asked me to wait as they will pass with water later on. The food includes the same apple pie as 3 years ago - no changes whatsoever. I called the cabin crew many times as I wanted to purchase something from duty free no one to respond to my call. They were busy wrapping up the flight before landing even 30 minutes prior to arrival. Simply bad experience with a high cost for the ticket.,2/1/2013,1,2,1,1,2,2
A Jackson,0,AMS-KUL-SIN and KUL-AMS. Really disappointed would sum up my feelings. It was my first experience of MH we usually fly SQ for our trips to the Far East. Dirty old looking plane that looked like it hadn't had a deep clean in years. Very old entertainment system which seemed to go faulty throughout the flight to the annoyance of passengers and indifference of crew. Outbound the crew seemed completely disinterested disappearing for hours after serving lunch much more friendly and professional crew on return trip but same stale hard product filthy toilets dirty worn out seats (arm rest came apart and seat would not remain upright). Food and beverages decidedly average with no choice on two of the four meals we had. Would only fly again as a very last resort.,3/31/2014,1,2,2,1,2,3
A Clark,0,Travelled to Corfu from Gatwick with Thomson bag drop had a queue so long it took us an hour and a half to drop bags plane was not the cleanest in the world. Landed at Corfu then had to queue outside on Tarmac for nearly an hour in 30 heat until doors were opened felt sick from aviation fuel smells cruise was excellent. Return to Gatwick queued outside terminal for an hour and half as had 6 flights and 3 check in staff then flight delayed so waited in packed terminal with no air con - was 34 degrees. Plane was late so to save time they didn't really clean it no food available on flight. Last time we use Thomson they charge for everything but service is so bad.,8/20/2014,0,2,1,0,2,2
Abshire John,0,I flew from Denver to San Diego on 8.59pm flight. We did not board until 9.20pm and started to taxi but returned to the gate due to the plane had a malfunction with one engine. We didn't taxi for another 20 minutes which all of this caused a serious delay! All of these events seemed to be a disorganization on Frontiers' behalf. After all of this confusion and frustration Frontier employees acted as if they did passengers a favor. No compensation was awarded i.e. beverages or anything. On top of this distraction I landed late causing my rental car reservation to be cancelled and had to barter with taxi drivers for transportation to my hotel. As far as I'm concerned this airline has the worst customer service bar none!,3/27/2014,2,4,2,5,4,2
A Jain,1,Mumbai-Bangalore. Flight on time great service from airport check-in to end stage. Well planned and executed model for passenger satisfaction. Taken to the aircraft by bus this afternoon flight was full yet the flight attendants were calm and courteous. They worked seamlessly with an almost natural smile. Aircraft clean. Onboard options for food were plenty though slightly pricey.,9/30/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Jalandoni,1,ORD-EVV on ERJ-145. Efficient and friendly male flight attendant. Plane small but overall fairly comfortable clean and well maintained.

A Clark,1,ORD-DCA and BWI-ORD. Overall the experience was very good. All flights departed and arrived on time and all employees were friendly. The trip was through a tour so the price or value cannot be determined. Security on Monday at O'Hare was very crowded so be sure to allot enough time. Boarding was organized and most bags were checked at the gate because the overhead bins would have been to crowded. The seats on board were very comfortable and recline was decent. The plane was an A319 that has not been reconfigured with the slimline seating. Crew was very nice and efficient and Inwas given an entire can of apple juice. We arrived at National Airport on time and the bags were very fast to come off of the carousel. The airport is very convenient to access downtown DC. Return was at BWI which is only 20 miles outside DC however traffic was a nightmare and it took almost an hour to get there. Gate agents at the airport were very friendly and efficient. Security is very smooth here and the airport is overall pleasant. Boarding was quick and the flight was operated by a 737-900ER. The seats were comfortable and no one bought the direct TV. Recline wasn't much which made sleeping difficult but I was not in economy plus. The crew on board were nice but not as good as others. The flight arrived on time and bags were quick to come out of the carousel. United seems like they are beginning to overcome merger issues now.,6/5/2014,5,4,4,2,4,8
Ada Sera,0,Take note! If you are planning a vacation with Sunwing please think again. This charter airline is starting to get a bad reputation due to their continual delays getting people to their destination or home. We are in Puerto Vallarta and were supposed to go home today. Our flight has been delayed by 14 hours! Unacceptable and never again.,10/5/2014,2,2,2,1,3,1
Adam Benjamin,0,I have just arrived back in the UK after the journey from hell the April 02 flight 72 hours from Bangkok to Gatwick. After being stranded in Sharjah UAE for 60 hours and an almost total lack of communication from Phuket Air I can do nothing other than urge anyone who is planning on taking a flight to cancel their tickets immediately and find someone/anyone other than these clowns to travel with.,4/5/2005,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Clarke,0,Flew executive from Vancouver to Nassau on Air Canada (YVR to YYZ) then Rouge (YYZ to NAS). The Air Canada portion in a pod was 9 out of 10 as the food wasnt great. I braced myself for the downgrade partly from some seriously bad reviews on this website. I was pleasantly surprised to find the seats we not bad food the same as Air Canada and the flight crew great. I thought Rouge was ok after all. Then came the return flight. We got to the airport only to find the flight had been cancelled and new flight would be 2 hours late. Then three then four and here's where things went downhill. I was now not going to make my connection in Toronto back to Vancouver. I was advised by a lady who barely looked up that I was now booked on a red eye out of Toronto. I said I wouldn't fly an overnight flight and could I please book the first flight out in the morning. She said no at first but then came back and said I would have to fly coach - I said no as I had an executive ticket. She said it's an aeroplan booking and added if you had a paid for an Air Canada ticket she may have been able to help me. Flew to YYZ - went right to Air Canada relations. They listened and gave a sincere apology for my treatment in Nassau. They ask me when I wanted to leave and although they were unable to give me complimentary hotel stay in they did offer to get me a special rate. Flight home on Air Canada B777 perfect breakfast was the best pancakes ever. Overall Rouge not so bad but their handlers in Nassau were rude and disrespectful. Would I fly Rouge again? Probably but wish Air Canada would take back the route.,10/8/2014,1,2,3,2,5,4
A Sargeant,1,Bangkok - Almaty - Astana - Novosibirsk. Good quick check and priority lane in busy Bangkok airport luggage slow off in Almaty (did not get priority despite the label). Good crew and food and wine. The 757 from Bangkok to Almaty was a little tired and angled seats should exclude an airline from four star status. The service from Almaty to Astana was good - a full meal served. From Astana to Novosibirsk there were problems in security checks and no fast lane for business class passengers. Staff helped people with tight connections. The domestic Business lounge in Almaty is very poor but the new lounge in Astana was good. I don't think that they deserve their four star rating but they are improving and the English of the Cabin attendants is a lot better than when I first flew with them 10 years ago. I will continue to choose to fly with them in Central Asia.,9/14/2014,3,4,5,3,4,9
Adam Denman,0,Flight DY 1336 SVG to LGW. Announced 2 hrs delay. No info no excuse no apology - nothing. After 2 hrs they announced another 30 mins delay. Again no info. Staff had no idea what was happening. Badly managed. Zero communication.,12/21/2013,1,3,0,0,1,NaN
Adam Floridia,0,After a five hour delay (understandable because it was weather related) we finally boarded our plane to San Francisco via Chicago. It wasn't until Chicago that they told us that our leg to San Francisco was canceled and the plane was now traveling to Los Angeles. Being stranded in Chicago with a five month old is not my idea of a vacation. On the return trip we got routed to Minneapolis (again weather). However when we did get to Chicago we were told we now had to switch planes for the final leg back to CT. We specifically booked flights with no plane change because that is a hassle with an infant. My family will never fly Southwest again.,7/19/2012,1,3,2,NaN,1,2
A Sargeant,1,MEL-BKK. Flights left and landed on time. Seat was comfortable and angled flat still got some hours of reasonable sleep between Melbourne and Bangkok. Food choice a little limited but portion size and taste was very good. Film selection not very good. Luggage did not get priority coming off the line in Bangkok - this seems a common complaint where airlines go through B to get to C. Staff very attentive and pleasant. Business class remains excellent value for money which is why I continue to fly them.,1/31/2014,5,4,4,3,5,9
Adam Khan,1,I went DTW-SFO AND SFO-DTW. Took Delta Airlines Boeing 767-300 both ways. The seat comfort was great! There was a lot of leg room. The staff wasn't very friendly. They weren't smiling that much or very polite. There was a lot of food selection and prices were decent. We got complimentary drinks twice which was great. The inflight entertainment system has a ton of selection although most of the movies and tv shows cost money. But the music selection was amazing so it was great. Overall the Delta flights were really good and I would definitely fly it again.,4/13/2014,4,4,3,4,2,8
A Clarke,1,Round trip to New York (EI 105/104). Flight out on time and the food was pretty decent I had upgraded my meal choice. Pretty quiet flight not too busy and plenty of space to stretch out although the middle armrest not lifting up all the way is pretty annoying if you're trying to spread out a bit. Fantastic crew. Return flight was fine food not as good and again great crew. However why is this flight scheduled to leave at the time it does (5.30 pm) and then arrive into Dublin 5.5 hours later it's fast but when you land in Ireland it's still only 11 pm in NYC. If the flight is that short and apparently it regularly is then could it not be scheduled it to arrive in Ireland the same day as it leaves NYC. Also I think it was a surprise to ground crew that we got back so early as we had to wait 50 mins for bags to arrive. Aside from that though good round trip.,3/4/2014,5,4,3,4,4,7
A Saunders,0,A horrible experience travelling from Toronto to Paris. Flight attendants didn't speak proper English and couldn't understand me. They just threw my food into my lap as I was trying to wake up and open my table and quickly walked away. They would walk around really fast and disappear for a long time probably hoping to avoid contact with passengers. I had to press the flight attendant button almost 6 times to get a glass of water. Food was okay but the fact that flight attendants were so bad just made the trip horrible. This was the first and last time I'll take Air France!,2/18/2014,3,3,2,3,1,2
Adam Louey,0,My much anticipated first flight on the Dreamliner turned out to be a bit of a disaster. My wife and I flew from Melbourne to Bangkok in economy. The entertainment system which we had pre booked did not work for either of us the screen had completely frozen and despite the best efforts of the crew to restart it numerous times it just would not go. Amazingly for such a new plane we were not the only one on the flight with this problem. The way JetStar have designed their entertainment unit is if it's unresponsive like ours were not only do you not get video but you cannot turn on the overhead light or call an attendant. It's all integrated in with each other. Due to the Dreamliner windows automatically shading out while mid flight we had to sit there in the dark with no entertainment or reading. Let me tell you it was a long 8 hour flight. I only picked JetStar for the Dreamliner experience. Never again.,3/4/2015,4,2,2,1,4,2
A Schaefer,0,I flew Edelweiss to Antalya a couple of days ago and back on its only A-330. The service was excellent and cabin crew very friendly. More movies would have been great. The plane was flown by CEO Kistler on the leg to Antalya. Unfortunately check-in at Antalya took relatively long since only 3 counters were open for an A-330-flight.,9/10/2003,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Clarke,1,LHR-DUB. A lot of passengers nearly missed the flight due to the screens in the terminal saying it was delayed by one hour only for the departure time to go back to the original at the last minute. Then with all the delays finding passengers the flight was running late only to be told we'd have to sit there and wait for 15 mins. Ended up taking off at the original delay time. Two different reasons given which was a bit odd. Comfy seats but an astonishingly bad menu selection.,2/24/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,5
A Scheepers,0,I regret flying with this airline - I have 2 kids ages 5 and 9yrs old and Mango made no provision for my kids to be seated next to me this happened on both flights of a return trip. I was told to ask the flight attendant for assistance in seating arrangements but when I attempted to do that the flight attendant told me I had to ask fellow passengers to move seats! The entire trip became an ordeal which detracted from what was supposed to be a fun- filled trip. I also noted that I was not the only parent who was not seated together with minors. The online booking process does not allow minors to travel without an adult so why then is this airline's management incapable of a simple task such as placing children with their parents - a task that is successfully achieved by every other airline in this country and indeed the world.,7/9/2010,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
Adam Miller,1,JNB-DUR. Easy check in friendly staff. Flight left on time and landed early in Durban. Very good value for money .Domestic travel within South Africa has become efficient and very competitive.,3/2/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Clarke,1,A return trip from Dublin to Malaga for a friends wedding the flight over left slightly late due chaotic boarding by the pax who seemed rather clueless as to what to do once you board a plane so you can't blame Ryanair for that. As per my last flights on FR they ran out of food and drink items and had a very limited selection and the service by a crew with a combined age of about 17 were slow and one rather got the impression that the four of them had just qualified the previous afternoon. They seemed stressed by the whole process and were again slow from the aft galley which is a surprise considering the lack of items they could possibly sell. There was a minor medical emergency where a pax fainted but they were quick and very attentive to deal with the situation. The flight back was again bereft of items from to purchase which was odd given that the plane was sitting on the ground the whole time I was at the gate before boarding (over an hour) but then even when you want to purchase something it's a bit of a guessing game due to the fact there are no menus. Anyway the flight began boarding early so early there were neither flight nor cabin crew on board. The flight itself was an awful experience due to being surrounded by children who took to screaming the majority of the time while their parents looked like they wanted to chuck themselves out the window. If I thought that the front of the cabin were an adults only area I would have paid anything to sit there maybe something to think about? All-in-all Ryanair are fine and are improving but it wouldn't be any harm to send mystery shoppers and auditors on flights occasionally to see what is really going on and realistically running out of the toilet paper hand towels. hand soap and saleable things like water is fairly unacceptable from a pax perspective.,5/13/2015,4,2,3,NaN,2,7
Adam Muller,0,"Flew BUD-BEG-LCA-BEG-VIE as it was far cheaper than any other airline low-costs including. BUD-BEG was on an older ATR72 there was exactly 12 passengers in the plane. Small snack (a sandwich and a cookie in a doggie bag) and one round of drinks on a one hour long flight! Had to ask specifically for the vegetarian meal we ordered (it was on the plane was labelled with my gf's name was not given out automatically). The ride was a little noisy as in the old ATR but can not complain. Problem-free transfer in BEG security at the gate and BEG-LCA on an ancient Boeing 737-300. It had the old JAT livery stripped down but one could still see the outline of the letters and three dots on the tail - from outside the plane looked just sad. Inside however the seats looked refurbished and to my surprise there was quite a lot of legroom. On this 2 hour flight hot meal was served (menu was handed out). I skipped mine my gf had her vegetarian meal and it looked and tasted fantastic. And a bonus - proper metal cutlery! Round of drinks as well. Return LCA-BEG departing at unholy time (4am in the morning) was delayed about half an hour making us worried about short connection in BEG. This time their ""new"" A319 which is not new at all. The legroom was much worse than on the old 737 and to be honest one of the worst I have ever experienced (I'm 185cm tall). Slept all time so can not comment on the food (but there was some). Bit unorganized transfer in BEG (we were checked all the way to VIE but some other passengers were missing their boarding passes) but I must appreciate that upon leaving the aircraft there was someone for each connecting flight helping the passengers. Last leg BEG-VIE on a sad ATR72 for me a cookie and a yoghurt in a doggie bag the vegetarian meal was an orange (that's it - just orange). Our luggage did not make the short connection in BEG. Air Serbia probably won't be my airline of choice but if they again offer such deal as they did now no problem flying them again.",4/27/2014,5,3,4,3,3,6
A Schreiner,1,Flew from Vancouver to Los Cabos on March 24. Flight was good cabin crew was excellent and no complaints.,4/1/2014,5,4,5,5,5,10
A Scot,0,Maiden trip from PIE to SWF on 10/31/13. On time definitely a no frills airline. Stewards and stewardesses complained the whole trip about having a 4hr layover. Now the return trip: My flight was scheduled for a timely departure! Approx 7.30pm that meant being there by 5.30. Never received text alert and airport screens showed on time schedule. An announcement was finally made at 7.15pm of the delay we would hopefully be boarding after it arrived at gate at 9.15-9.30. After arriving after midnight I still had a 2 hr drive home. I can usually fly back and forth with just a personal item but rudeness is unacceptable. Everything is an added fee: seat water snack carry on checked bag priority seating etc.,1/28/2014,1,1,0,0,1,1
A Clarke,1,DUB-STN and then STN-SVQ a couple of days later. Effortless flying really just a gripe with the horrendous food you have to buy (obviously you don't have to). Had something that was meant to be fresh but had a best before of July 15. The cabin crew never look happy and were nice to the pax but not so much to each other.,6/4/2014,5,3,2,NaN,4,8
Adam Paterson,0,Dubai to Shiraz last year. Rather than paying for a hotel for the evening we camped in the abandoned kids playground hidden behind a small house in the airport. Morning came and we were ready to leave our plane was not. We were told all sorts of nonsense 'the plane will leave tomorrow or the day after' 'the plane will leave in a few hours' 'the plane has broken down' 'there is bad weather preventing flying'. Twelve hours later we left. I spent 24 solid hours in Dubai airport. The best toilets are the oldest ones furthest away from the duty free shops they're less used so hence less filthy. Finally got on the plane and they'd crammed three flights together into a massive pre- revolution 747. I felt bad for the staff copping a lot of flak and working a 14 hour day. The flight was short and the delay mammoth but perhaps it was all worth it because we met so many people! In short fly Iran Air if you have free time wanting to meet some locals. If you're running to any sort of schedule do not fly Iran Air,4/26/2009,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,2
A Scott,0,I am a business traveler and I have seen the industry change over the years. I no longer expect outstanding service and all that goes with it. My expectations have been 'right-sized' over the years. But my last two flights on Alitalia will be my last two flights on Alitalia. Not only was the service awful but the plane hadn't seen proper cleaning and service since the 90s. I flew the same aircraft 4 days apart and the lav didn't work coming or going. I cannot understand how it is possible. I chose the flight ONLY because it was direct from Rome to Chicago but I would prefer to spend the extra time changing planes somewhere just to avoid this awful airline. And as a side note I returned on Saturday and today is Monday. I am still waiting for my luggage.,9/6/2014,3,1,3,2,1,NaN
A Clarke,0,LHR/EWR/LHR. B757 out and B767 return. Outward flight was just OK. Inflight entertainment was good and the seat fairly comfortable. The big let down was the crew. They were efficient but showed no personality at all and I did not see a single smile from them. The return flight was disappointing. The entertainment system offered very little choice was shown on tiny screens and from what I could see quite a few screens including mine were broken or were only showing half a picture. Again the crew were robotic with no personality at all and although efficient they seemed totally disinterested. Unlike other airlines on the route who offer a free bar only soft drinks are free on United. All in all United seem to be offering a budget almost 'No Frills' service but at the same price as other transatlantic carriers who offer a far better experience.,11/17/2014,1,3,1,2,1,3
Adam Solak,1,First flying business class. London to Bangkok via Istanbul. Seat on first leg was not a full recliner but comfortable enough. Second leg the seat was amazingly comfortable. Kept champagne flowing and so much food I missed the second meal on Bangkok leg. Staff were very polite answer attentive. Wish I could afford to fly business class all the time.,2/24/2015,4,4,4,5,5,10
A Sehwerert,1,The staff at JFK need to be re-trained a bit in customer relations but onboard treated with professionalism service as good or better than most US airlines. Food in economy was good and it came with free wine or beer. Ground staff in Spain was great.,2/28/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
Adam Taylor,0,LHR-TUN return. Both legs were on 2 of the older A320's in the fleet which are showing their age! The flight from LHR left 1 hour later than the STD however this was due to the aircraft arriving late from Tunis. Upon return the flight left 45 minutes late as there was no Ramp staff in Tunis to load the baggage and hence we had to wait for these to become available to load the baggage/cargo before we could depart. The food even by airline food quality is very poor. However the seating in economy is very impressive both in width and pitch. It must also be said that the cabin crew are extremely helpful and very polite.,11/23/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,6
A Jamieson,1,Leeds Bradford to Split return flights were on time and very comfortable. Staff were cheerful on both legs of my journey chatty and helpful throughout. The guys on the return flight had been on the receiving end of a rowdy crowd on the way out to Split but they were in good humour with us in spite of having had a tough outward journey. Drinks snacks and pre-ordered meals all acceptable with a reasonable selection on the trolley. The seats are comfortable for this type of short journey and offer a bit more room than other holiday airlines so I have a preference for Jet2 over Thomson/Thomas Cook flights for holidays. Check in at both airports was trouble free. The facilities at Leeds Bradford were excellent too.,7/15/2013,4,4,3,NaN,5,9
A Serna,1,I fly Iberia at least 4 times every month. I have to say that the airline is working much better now. Most of the flights arrive on time the fleet is quite new and the crew has made an effort with better service. I have made the BRU-MAD flight often and they are always on time. Last week I flew MAD-MIA. The flight was pleasant the seat comfortable the individual screen is wonderful good films TV series and music. The minus point: the food was not good at all! The ravioli were disappointing and the salad was very poor. The crew were efficient but I think some members of staff should make more of an effort they speak in a very abrupt way.,10/29/2013,5,4,2,5,3,8
Adam Wang,1,London-Istanbul-Beijing Economy class. I have to say this is the best economy class I have experienced. For both segments Turkish delights are served immediately after takeoff the food is completely at different classes against other European airlines juice was freshly squeeze orange juice. For the long haul flight we were given slippers ear phones toothbrush and toothpaste and so on which you do not expect in economy class. However the drawback is the geography of Turkey has made the flight much longer and the staff in the Istanbul airport are absolute nightmare although they are not the faults of the airline. However I have worries about passenger behaviour once the aircraft has touched down people are standing up and collecting their luggage from the overhead storage this is the case whether the aircraft is either still on or just leaving the main landing ways. I feel sorry for the cabin crews as there are just so many people and there are little things the crews could do about it.,3/17/2014,5,4,5,5,4,10
A Janitens,0,Just had the worst experience on an aircraft and will never fly Air Canada Rouge again. Flew 8 hours to Venice (9 back). Absolutely no leg room (if you're 5'8' or taller). Seats only go back an inch or two (but then again-that's because there is no leg room). No overhead controls for air. Also took 20 minutes for an attendant to answer our call button. Our movies cut out 6 times. Had to restart and judge where we'd left off. Absolutely dreaded our return flight. Never again.,8/28/2014,2,1,2,2,2,1
A Shah,0,We flew on Cubana to Hrvana via Holguin check in was chaotic. The plane was very old no inflight entertainment and food was not that great either. You have pay for any extra hard or soft drinks. The staff were very old compared to other airlines. The return on was worse. The plane had a fault and we had to wait for another plane. We were kept at the airport for over 8 hours with one sandwich and 1 drink. No toilet paper in the toilets and no inflight entertainment. Please do not book unless you have no choice.,8/26/2008,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,1
Adam Williams,1,I flew from Gatwick to Paphos on a 757-200 and from Paphos to Gatwick on a 737-800. Both flights were excellent the seats were very comfortable and there was excellent legroom. The cabin crew were extremely friendly and I thoroughly enjoyed the flight. I brought a cheese and ham Panini on board and thinking it would be horrible as most airline food is it was actually very tasty. The only moan was that we were delayed leaving Gatwick by 20 minutes but was because 5 people were late for the flight. Not at all Thomson's fault. Going from Paphos to Gatwick was on time. Both airports were great. Would recommend.,10/13/2014,4,5,4,0,5,9
A Shannon,0,Will never fly with US Airways again. Everyone boarded and was kept on flight for an hour due to maintenance problems. Temperature in Phoenix while stuck on the flight was over 100 degrees. We were kept waiting on the flight for an hour. Water was brought around but it was poured into cups. We were not given full bottles. Turns out there was an issue with a window. Flight was delayed an hour then a couple more hours. Currently flight is pushed back to 6 pm with an original 10.45am departure time.,7/1/2013,1,3,1,1,1,NaN
A Jarrett,1,The cabin crew were attentive helpful and genuine. B777-200 spacious and comfortable leg room generous and seats were designed with storage areas footrest and lumbar support. The cushioning was perhaps a little hard with age but still comfortable. The inflight entertainment was straightforward to operate and on-demand worked well. The lack of alcohol (this is a no alcohol airline) did not bother me. Meals were generous and of good quality. Online Check In was straightforward and airport bag drop was fast and efficient.,5/4/2013,5,4,4,5,5,9
A Shaw,0,Business class SGN-SYD 28/1. Traveling alone with 2 children. I booked 3 seats in a row 3A 3C and 3D. Plan was to sit 2 year old next to window as quiet and dark and therefore hopefully (for everyone's sake) she would sleep! At departure gate I was told seat 3A is broken and given new boarding cards all in different parts of the cabin. I explained my 2 year old could not sit alone however no alternative could be found except me in the 'broken' seat next to her. Cant understand why departure staff could not have rearranged seating prior to gate to accommodate us together. IFE terrible seats even those that worked were hard and uncomfortable. This airline is deteriorating each year.,1/31/2013,2,1,3,2,3,2

A Shkaruba,1,AMS-KJA-AMS. Boarding in Amsterdam was the horror - more than half an hour at the business class check in and total mess in the departure area. AMS-SVO was okay. Old B767 clean but worn no entertainment nice food the crew unengaged and strangely non-relaxed. Transfer in SVO had slightly improved since the last time but the same one has to get all the luggage travel with it about 1 km and check in again. The navigation system in the terminal is confusing but manageable. Business lounge in the domestic departure terminal D is small heavily smelling with tobacco and a strange selection of food - basically only rolls and cookies. A bit more food is available from the bar for extra pay. SVO-KJA a new A321; the seats were standard economy class with standard pitch which was a bit painful in the overnight flight food good the crew was slightly more attentive to passenger needs. The return flight was the same with the only comment that business lounge in the Terminal F is way worse than in the Terminal D - not clean even stronger tobacco smell and no food at all but Terminal F is terrible in itself so no big surprise. It is a recommendation for this route but only because this is the only option available.,10/11/2012,2,3,3,2,5,3
A Jhunjhunwala,1,Mumbai - Johannesburg return in Economy class. Plane was A330. Flights on time. Decent Indian vegetarian meals. Excellent in flight entertainment.

A Johansson,0,Sweden to Washington DC return. Tickets were cheap however you don't get any food during the flight everything has to be paid for. On my return our flight was cancelled due to technical difficulties. Things were chaotic and there didn't seem to be a plan to deal with this. I was forced to stay for 48 hours extra at a hotel. The support were not located at the Dulles airport so they couldn't help me with my hotel accommodation. They only had one flight out from Dulles each day so their local personal arrived around 3pm. Yes it's cheap but if something goes wrong expect to have some extra trouble. I have now learnt that there is a big advantage of travelling with a big airline or at least airlines that have more than one flight each day at the specific airport.,9/5/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,2
A Shmuely,0,JFK to GIG on Nov 21st and return on November 30 from GIG to JFK. Flying business class all over the world with different airlines. They are by far the worst that I have experienced. Lousy old planes broken seats and tray tables entertainment system consists of ipads horrible food and drinks selections (half of what is on the menu not available). They are known to cancel flights for mechanical failures. The crew were nice and were aware of their company's issues.,2/18/2015,1,1,1,1,2,1
Aditi Saldanha,0,Flown this airline twice from Amsterdam to Detroit and had a terrible experience each time. My flight departing from Amsterdam has always never left on time. Both times my flight was delayed at least 2 hours so in both cases I have missed my onward connecting flight in Detroit. This also resulted in my bag not arriving on time. However apart from the fact that I have never been on a Delta flight that has left or arrived on time the in- flight experience is quite good. Their food is always hot and very tasty they have a good variety in their in flight entertainment and their seats are quite comfy. But due to the fact that I have been delayed and missed my flight so many times because of Delta I will probably never fly them again.,11/20/2014,4,4,5,5,3,5
A Johnson,0,I had no idea what Air Canada Rouge was until after I had booked. We found a good deal online from YVR to HON for spring break so booked. Flight was on time leaving YVR and aircraft seemed clean and tidy but seats were a bit cramped in terms of leg room and elbow room. The flight attendants were all very friendly and bubbly as one would expect from new grads - I liked the attempt to look trendy with the uniforms. What was disappointing though for my two young children was that there was no in-flight entertainment. It would have been helpful to know that one needed the iPad app ahead of time. Also disappointing the lack of good available - you would think Mac and cheese would be the obvious to stock up on this flight. What was extremely disappointing was to find out the day of checkout was that our 10.15pm flight had been delayed by 4 hours. What was even more aggravating was to find out through 3 further emails that our flight was delayed even more. The final straw that broke the camel's back was to check in and then find out that our flight would be delayed 7.45 hours. So here I am sitting in Honolulu airport writing this in frustration at 4am because I can't sleep and have two exhausted children on hand. Had we known this earlier we would have just booked a hotel room. What I find insulting is the airline's idea of compensation for this is $10 meal vouchers - what a slap in the face. On top I find it ironic that the airline is 7.45hours delayed which is just under 8 hours on their website for which they would provide accommodations for. I'm sitting here in the airport probably with 100+ passengers looking as exhausted and frustrated as I am and probably thinking the same thing - never again. As I peruse the Internet wish I found this website earlier as I hear this is not the first time this has happened.,3/18/2015,1,2,1,1,4,1
A Shum,1,Singapore-Perth. Except for the price the flight was not pleasant. The purser was rude with a passenger and her junior crew. The other crew seemed frustrated working with her.

A Silberstein,0,I traveled to NY in December of 2013 and although the flight out was fine and on time the flight back was cancelled and no flights were available for several days I ended up purchasing a one way ticket from Southwest which was one counter down for a full fare and made it back that night. Spirit never offered a refund or any compensation for cancelling a flight and not accommodating Last night my daughter was supposed to fly back from Florida to Chicago her flight was first delayed then finally cancelled. Again the airline did not offer any help and the first flight available they offered was 3 days later! which is outrageous! We found another flight on Spirit with available seat but the airline refused to allow the use of that seat and at best after demanding to talk to a supervisor we were told that non are available for 2 hours (which is after the flight departs). Needless to say we are so disappointed with this airline that we will never recommend for anyone to fly with them.,1/8/2014,1,1,0,0,1,NaN

A Johnson,0,Flight was fine but bag drop (we checked in online) was dreadful. We arrived 2.5 hours before departure. No staff were at the bag drop before 1hr 50 mins before departure by which time there was a huge queue (back to the door of the terminal). At the beginning only two desks were manned and it took us over an hour to get to the front of the queue. However once our bags had been tagged we had to join a further huge queue with our bags to put them on a conveyor belt! The staff were rude and disinterested. Fortunately the security staff and passport control were quick and efficient and then we had to queue again to get into the gate. The gate had virtually no chairs and we ended up standing and queuing for over 2 hours. In fact the only free time we stole for ourselves was 5 minutes to go to the toilet. A truly awful experience. Very disappointed in Easyjet. Flight EZ5014 (Bordeaux - Gatwick) BOD-LGW.,6/30/2013,3,3,0,NaN,1,2

Adrian Gifford,1,Flying to Dubai from Manchester on 15th March 2015 Boeing 777 flight EK022 seat 21e and 21d. We found the service very poor. The female flight attendant never smiled or offered any greeting. We were not offered any drinks but had to ring the call button twice to get a response. On the second occasion for some water again rang twice and from the first call to receiving the drink was just over 11 minutes. This was before and after lunch not at a busy time. At lunch we had to ask for coffee which the male attendant leaned over to pore I had to ask for milk and sugar. The coffee was lukewarm and the attendant was equally out of sorts with himself. We have never had this treatment on previous Emirate flights. I wondered if we were on a no frills flight or was it because we can only afford to fly economy. Our return on 30th March was just the opposite with friendly crew and excellent service.,4/14/2015,2,4,4,4,1,5
A Simm,0,Booked in August 2012 to fly from Manchester to Toronto in May 2013 for our honeymoon. Air Transat called in March 2013 to inform us that our Manchester flights had been cancelled and we could only fly from Gatwick on those dates. No apology was given no offer of compensation or even transport to and from Gatwick. We were then offered alternate dates to fly to from Manchester which we took. Upon check in at Manchester it became apparent the seats we had booked had been changed due to the change in dates after some discussion we were offered extra legroom seats for free which were excellent. The flight took off and landed on time it was an old plane with shared screens playing videos during the flight. The food was edible and came with a very small glass of wine. The return flight which was also on time was a refurbished plane with new leather seats and personnel touch screens. If they hadnâ€™t cancelled our flights I would have given them an excellent rating for the price but I would not trust making expensive holiday arrangements that rely on one of their flights again following this experience.,5/14/2013,5,4,3,3,3,6
A Johnston,1,YYZ-DEL-CCU in business class. Clean plane working seats with recline for sleeping (not flat bed) reasonable Indian food service and hospitable staff. Slept for 7 hrs and enjoyed the flight especially the early arrival in DEL. Fair selection of video considering almost all of their passengers onboard are Indian. Air India staff supported my transit in DEL in an efficient manner and customs was provided on arrival in CCU.,11/30/2011,4,4,3,3,4,7
Adrian Johnston,0,NBO-ADD-BKK-HKG in business class on old 767 planes. While I am fully aware that this airline has both 777 and new 787 planes these old 767s are in very poor condition. Broken seats poor leg rest (really no leg rest unless you are very short) and very worn fabric. I travel in Africa and thought that I should start using Ethiopian as a Star Alliance member but this will be my last trip unless I see that I will be on one of the newer planes. I travel over 100K miles each year and this has to rank as my poorest experience.,11/6/2012,2,2,3,1,4,2
A Simpson,0,"It is now very obvious why Allegiant's pricing is so economical. I guess as with everything else in life you get what you pay for. Apparently they do not know how to schedule their pilots efficiently and therefore have to cancel flights when they don't have a pilot for the flight that you paid for. To make matters worse, they cannot tell you when your flight will be. So now we are stranded in Raleigh, North Carolina waiting for either a phone call or text message to let us know when our flight will be. They refused to offer any assistance for hotels for the night and say they do not do that despite the fact that this is an Allegiant problem, not mine. They have been less than helpful and offered little to no assistance or information as to when and how I will be getting home from my vacation. So we will continue to sit and wait on Allegiant to figure out what they're going to do to get us home and until then we're stranded in Raleigh.",8/1/2015,1,1,NaN,NaN,1,1
A Coldrey,0,I will never fly Qatar Airways again flying Manchester-Doha-Johannesburg and return. Outbound flight good friendly check in assistant who allocated me an emergency exit seat with extra leg room because of my disability. Worst problem was the 7 hour wait in Doha which we were aware of. However on the return flight unfriendly and unwilling to assist at check in even though I am registered on their site as disabled and therefore not able to check in online no assistance given. We were given our tickets and thankfully I checked our connection from Doha to Manchester and it had been changed and we were not informed. This resulted in a six hour wait in Doha instead of an hour and half. No assistance given on either leg of journey to allocate me extra legroom and only when we were about to board the flight from Doha to Manchester we then discovered we were in separate rows but I had been allocated a middle seat which with my disability makes it worse. We managed to change seats on the airplane thanks to a helpful fellow traveler but with no assistance from the airline crew. Also found the seats very uncomfortable and had a sore back for days after returning home. Never again!,4/6/2015,2,1,2,2,2,1
Adrian McKay,0,4 flights on MH in Business Class. MH 726 Jakarta to KL: The 2 female flight attendants serving were friendly and managed to address passengers by name. Although upon boarding neither were smiling. and indeed they look most unhappy. The forward toilet was dirty. I was also surprised that my cutlery had not been properly cleaned. The issue of MH's Nasi Lemak has received a lot of media coverage and yet the product on the flight from Jakarta to KL was not complete - it was only rice with prawns in a sauce with an egg. MH 129 KL to Melbourne: Boarding was efficient crew friendly and generally service was good. However the purser did not seem to do anything except look unhappy and did not interact with more than a couple of passengers. Surprised to be told that champagne could not be served while the aircraft was on the ground! The selection of newspapers and magazines needs to be less myopic. Similarly a better selection of world business and general interest magazines would be appreciated. MH 146 Melbourne to KL: Flight was much less enjoyable and probably only saved by the efforts of the female flight attendant in business class who made up for the poor service from the two other males and flight service director. She was the only person who addressed me by name. No menus available. The two male flight attendants went about their jobs with the minimum of interaction with customers service was very off-hand. The chef-on-call dish of beef was very tough. Most times when I went to use the toilets at the rear of the business class cabin they were occupied. As there were only 10 passengers in business class and they were all in their seats it suggests that the flight attendants allowed economy passengers to use the business class toilets. MH 723 KL to Jakarta: Not much to complain about although the flight attendant did not address passengers by name.,2/28/2014,4,3,2,2,2,5
A Singh,1,Los Angeles - Heathrow - Los Angeles over the holidays. Club world is a perfectly fine business product. Staff on both legs were very good getting the job done in a polite and friendly way. Food again is pretty good and benefits from covering the basics well and not being overly fussy. Portion sizes not huge but I don't need the calories anyway. Plenty of drinks offered. An unexpected nice touch was when during the outbound night flight as the only passenger awake a crew member popped her head over asked if I was ok and if I would like a hot chocolate - and then went and made one. In terms of product this is not a million miles away from United business (both even have backwards-facing seats). However the BA cabin crew are in a class of their own and it feels like they know it which translates in to good service. United's intercontinental crews are a somewhat more eclectic group whose get-up-and-go appears to have got-up-and-gone. Just like with the 747 the upstairs on the A380 has side storage which is useful. The upstairs front section bathrooms are also huge (and from the front section you can go up and down the stairs if that tickles your fancy). But downstairs is light and roomy. On return on Dec 29 I was delayed at the gate at Heathrow as staff fussed over various 'company' passengers that needed to be accommodated. These company passengers - flight crew heading off on vacation - then unluckily sat next to me in Club and behaved appallingly for 11 hours - drinking champagne constantly loudly talking all night and demanding a running commentary on the ins-and-outs of working the A380 from every crew member that passed. They acted like children who had never been on a plane before - and their taking 'selfies' (that included me in the background!) all flight was mildly vexing. Upshot? As long as BA doesn't stiff you by putting its staff on freebie upgrades next to you you'll enjoy club world on the A380.,1/11/2015,5,4,4,4,5,8
Adrian Mullane,0,"A classic bait and switch move by Norwegian. I booked a r/t flight (LAX-CPN-LAX) on Norwegian back in December and a few weeks back they text me to tell me that my flight in late May would be operated by EuroAtlantic airways. It was with an all Portuguese crew in an old Boeing 777. No inflight entertainment on either leg. Well unless you count 2 Audi channels featuring Latin music. I too paid extra for ""nice and tasty menu"" which was neither nice or tasty. Everyone got the same meal so don't bother paying up for that. Also sure to bring your own movies. By the time Norwegian told me about the switch it was too late to get a good price on another airline. Buyer beware!",5/28/2014,1,2,1,1,3,1
A Cole,0,"Our flight was cancelled, and the next flight they offered us was two days later. No help with hotels or any kind of reimbursement other than a refund for our cheap tickets. We ended up re-booking with another airline, which of course cost more money than what Spirit refunded us. You may think you are saving money by booking with Spirit, but if they cancel your flight and leave you stranded (which appears to be a common occurrence) it will end up costing you more than if you had gone with a reliable airline. When they emailed us that the flight was cancelled, the phone number they provided to reach them did not actually connect with anything. None of the phone numbers we tried got through to anyone. Ridiculous.",6/23/2015,1,1,1,1,1,1
Adrian Sineriz,1,We flew to and from Madrid and we left and arrived on time. Both trips take about 11 hours and the experience was good. The seat is confortable though it is not a flat bed and the food was good. The plane was a rather old B747.,7/11/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Conroy,1,Recently travelled from Manchester to Vancouver and return. We were concerned after reading some reviews. However all our worries were groundless flights were on time staff courteous and efficient service and food excellent. Not having individual TV screens was mildly inconvenient but we knew that was the case when we booked. We would not hesitate to travel with Air Transat again and shall recommend.,6/23/2013,4,4,4,3,5,9
A Skidmore,1,MCO-SFO 7/11/12. Not sure what I was expecting from this flight I guess being English I expect a 5+ hr flight to be treated as long haul and the service to match. Surprised when I saw they were using an A320 on this route by the end of this flight I struggled to straighten out. If you're over 6 feet tall I'd recommend paying for additional leg-room. Other than the leg room the seats were comfortable and the interior of the plane was very trendy. Mood lighting and condensation keeping the cabin relaxed with music whilst boarding gave a relaxing ambience. Entertainment system was impressive with a large range of on demand TV and movies (albeit at a charge). Being able to use the entertainment system throughout taxi take off and landing is a nice sensible approach. WiFi is pretty good and fast seems a little overpriced but it is a very fast service compared to other airlines carrying this feature. Main disappointment was that nowhere on my reservation did it mention there was no meal or snack provided during the flight so having boarded hungry I only managed to last 3 hours before purchasing a meal. Meals come as a large snack box which is very competitively priced at 7 dollars. Free soft drinks is a nice touch but alcohol is overpriced and being able to order drinks on demand from your seat is also handy when you're settled. Generally cabin crew were friendly and the pilot giving his announcement stood in the cabin adds to the edgy nature of end airline. Dressed down uniforms and a relaxed approach is a little different to other airlines but I think Virgin have found a good balance. All in all I would use them again but I wish they'd make a few of the inflight charges more obvious prior to ticket purchase. And 5 hours is a bit too long to be in such a small seat!,7/15/2012,4,3,3,3,3,6
Adrian Walsh ,0,"Delayed, further delayed and then cancelled due to fog even though other airlines were landing and taking off. Poor communication throughout.

A Coogans,1,STN-GLA: Last flight of the day to GLA and Stansted Airport was very quiet. The flight was uneventful but did manage to leave and arrive 20 minutes early. Usual slightly cramped seating cabin crew were efficient and friendly. The only real issue was Easyjet's new hand baggage policy - why should I take care to adhere to their requirements when there was nobody policing this at Stansted and the passenger in front carried on 5 pieces of hand luggage?,9/18/2013,4,3,0,NaN,3,8
Adriansz Allison,1,10/1/15-17/1/15. QZ547 and QZ 544. My husband and I travelled on Air Asia Perth to Denpasar return last week and the flights were fine. The Perth to Denpasar flight left 30 minutes early and as it wasn't a full flight my husband was able to stretch out and have a sleep. The Denpasar to Perth flight was full but once again there were no issues. The flight attendants did their jobs competently. I would definitely recommend Air Asia for short trips.,1/23/2015,5,5,4,4,5,10
A Smith,1,LHR-JFK return. Was quite nervous travelling with this airline after reading some reviews on here but was pleasantly surprised with the service. Both flights on time and actually arrived at the gates early. No queues for check-in at Heathrow and a very small 10 minute wait at JFK. Boarding a little messy in Heathrow due to the small number of seats available but this is BAA's problem and not Kuwait's. Hot snacks and a hot meal served on LHR-JFK leg with a hot meal and cooked breakfast with fruit served on JFK-LHR. In flight entertainment is seat back TVs on Boeing 777 can be a bit hit and miss we were a party of four and only half the screens worked. Overall offers excellent value for money compared to competitors on this route and would definitely travel with them again.,8/29/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
A Cooper,0,Had the misfortune of flying Melbourne - Washington DC via AUH last year in December. The planes were old and shabby. On one of the legs I was forced to sit in one of the 'love seats' with a complete stranger. I couldn't sleep as I had to keep moving his leg off my bed yes they really are that close! Complained to the airline via email they chose not to respond.,7/12/2014,1,1,3,2,4,1
Afni Adnan,1,SZB-Subang-Penang return trip: Superb trips clean aircraft on time. Flight attendants were very helpful and appreciate the light refreshments which were factored into the bill. The trip back was even better because we were given the very front seats at no extra cost. I was travelling with my parents who are senior citizens and the ground staff were very alert and upon looking at the I.Cs I gave her at the check in counter she quickly asked if they needed help getting to the aircraft. When I said they were very fit she double checked if they were okay being seated right in front because they had 'to walk a bit further' in a plane which is actually very small. I found it a bit amusing but the politeness and concern is what matter most. Will definitely fly again. The fact that it is based in Subang is also a bonus point for me.,8/21/2013,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
A Smith,1,HKG-ICN-GUM. Quite possibly the best airline I have ever flown with. On both legs I was impressed aircraft's were modern and clean (A330 and B777) more than the average number of FA's. FA's were professional friendly and helpful inflight entertainment available as soon as you sit down FA's speak excellent English much more leg room for an economy seat than you would get with another airline in flight entertainment available behind each seat with many many options. Wasn't crazy about the food but did like the Haagen Daz ice cream for dessert. Don't ever really expect much of airline food anyway though. One of the few airlines I would go out of my way to fly with again.,9/16/2012,5,5,3,5,5,10
A Copeland,1,I have used Silverjet for the first time in the last week. The whole experience beats premium economy hands down and comes as close as makes no difference to Virgin upper. The fact that it is also far less expensive alternative to premium economy is a nice bonus. The attendants were polite and efficient food as good as I have experienced checking in and Luton lounge a pleasure. This is a new company trying to serve a need in the market with finite resources - there will always be teething problems.,10/16/2007,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

A Coppola,0,I was delayed 26 hours on a Lanseria (HLA) to Durban flight on 11 June. Departure was initially 17:30. We were first told that we were delayed for 3 hours. Then we were told we were leaving at 23:30. At 23:00 they told us the flight was cancelled. Put up in some lodge and told they would fly us out the next day at 14:40 on a specially chartered plane. This never materialised. I was lied to the following day regarding departure times and the mystery charter plane. Eventually told we were on a 16:20 flight. At 16:00 they told us it was delayed to 18:20! Finally my nightmare ended at 20:00 on 12 June when we finally touched down in Durban. Throughout the ordeal the staff were unsympathetic and we were made to feel that the problem was ours.,6/14/2009,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,1

A Smithee,1,LAX-SFO: Simple flight made easier by a relaxed crew. Great entertainment system blankets and pillows and a nice flow of a small meal and after-meal snack plus plenty to drink. Flight crew was very attentive from the moment of boarding and remained friendly throughout. Never had a grumpy flight crew with Virgin which cannot be said for other domestic carriers.

Ahmad Aweidah,1,7th Jan AZ 809. Return 10th Jan AZ 812. TLV-FCO-TLV in economy I was dreading this flight after reading the reviews and having faint memories of my Alitalia flights over 10 years ago. The price was very reasonable and not much more than easyjet so I went with Alitalia. The plane out was an old A320 but refurbished so looked ok and was in a decent condition. I was very impressed with the seat pitch and comfort it was great  better than most economy I've tried on other airlines. The food is very basic and their is no flight entertainment but anyway it a short 3 hour flight. Same experience on the way back and i was very satisfied with the overall experience. Both flight on time and luggage was very quickly delivered. The crew were polite and friendly and id what they needed to do. I would definitely use them again especially if the prices remain competitive.,1/19/2015,5,5,3,0,3,9
A Cosham,1,VLC-AMS. Flight was on time staff were friendly and efficient cabin was bright clean well presented. The seat was better than expected with the pocket for magazines higher up behind the tray table giving a couple of cm extra legroom making it perfectly acceptable for a flight of a couple of hours. A comfort level comparable or better than Transavia and Easyjet. For the price paid an excellent flight and I would not hesitate to use them again.,4/16/2013,4,4,4,0,5,9
A Snelling,1,IAD-BRU-LYS in economy. Brussels Airlines was the low-cost provider and I cannot say anything super negative about them. Flights were on time food was decent and AVOD was more than adequate. FA's were not overly friendly but were helpful enough. Perhaps my cost-conscious flying experiences recently have lowered my expectations a bit too far but I thought Brussels Airlines was fine. Would definitely recommend and use again.,4/22/2015,3,4,4,4,4,8
A Snelling,0,"DAY-HAM round trip in Dec 2014/Jan 2015. All I can say is ""the absolute bare minimum"" from United.

We got delayed an hour because the engine on the airplane won't start, according to the pilot the engine was to hot and they had to turn off the entire airplane electricity, which left us without AC on the plane and the summer heat of Kuwait. They could at least let us go back to the boarding gate, until the engine gets fixed. Luckily the engine started and we were on our way to Abu Dhabi. We were served a chicken sandwich and water. That's it. No, salad, fruit or dessert. Nothing, but a mayo-filled chicken sandwich and water. Very disappointed with this airline, first and last time flying Etihad",7/21/2015,2,2,1,1,1,4

A Snyder,0,"We planned a trip from Pittsburgh Airport to Memphis Airport (supposed to be a 4hr 45min trip). We were traveling with a 3 yr old. We arrived at Pittsburgh Airport with our flight scheduled to leave at 6.30pm when checking in they said that our flight was delayed due to bad weather and offered to move us to a flight leaving at 4.45pm we agreed and actually made it in time to board. Once it was our turn to board we were told our boarding passes were not valid and had to get out of line to go back to the lady at the boarding counter to receive new boarding tickets. We finally boarded the plane and eventually made it to our first lay-over at Chicago Airport. Ended up waiting at this airport for almost 5 hrs for our plane to arrive. Yet again when trying to board we handed the lady our boarding passes and she scanned them and was told they were invalid. Again we had to get out of line and wait until we were cleared by whomever she called about the matter. After finally getting on the plane we waited an additional 20 minutes for a passenger who for some reason or another was late. Finally we landed at Memphis Airport at 11.15pm an hour behind schedule and thank goodness our rental car place was kind enough to wait 20+ minutes after they closed at 11pm so we could get our rental we had reserved. I was hoping our flight home would be less eventful not so lucky! We arrived at Memphis Airport and things went smoothly (I had high hopes after this) we arrived at Orlando FL airport. Once we arrived at Orlando airport things went downhill. We almost immediately found out that our 4.15 flight to Pittsburgh was delayed due to ""weather"" and wouldn't be leaving until 6.45 pm. After trying to figure out a plan we called customer service at Southwest and was told that she didn't know why we were told that our flight was delayed due to weather in fact it had to make an emergency landing in Baltimore due to mechanical issues. 6 long hours later we finally took off around 7pm and arrived at Pittsburgh Airport 5 hrs behind schedule at 11.40pm.

Ahmad Nadim,0,In July last year my wife and I travelled from Manchester UK to Toronto. Queuing for check in: I am a wheelchair user. I don't demand it but most airlines let wheelchair users join a fast queue for Check in. I don't demand it but have to say that it is a polite gesture this polite gesture was missing with Air Canada. Check in: was chaotic with long queues and check in staff seemed all over the place. It took us almost 1.5 hrs to reach the check in counter only to see that half the check in counters were not even open. Boarding: As we arrived at the boarding gate and were showed boarding passes we realised that me and my wife had been allocated seats a few rows apart. To the credit of airline staff they quickly sorted this out and put us in premium economy. Although they told us that we will have to pay for the entertainment and food but once we were on board they did not charge us. Arrival in Toronto: Because I need assistance to get on and off the plane I have to wait until everyone has gone. Usually it takes 5 to 10 minutes but this time it took over 45 minutes for assistance to arrive because no one knew that a passenger needed assistance to disembark the plane. Please note that I had requested the check in staff in Manchester twice to make sure that people know in Toronto that I will need assistance. Luggage collection: Upset and frustrated we arrived in the lounge to collect our suitcase. Everyone from our flight had collected luggage and gone. No carousel information was available. First we tried to look for our suitcase and then I found Air Canada customer service counter and queued to ask which carousel our suitcase would have arrived at. All of this took another hour and half almost but still no staff was available to help. Eventually we found our suitcase near one carousel. This was the first time we travelled with Air Canada and will be the last.,1/19/2015,1,1,3,2,2,2

Instead of three rows of seats A and B we were now slung across a single row with 4 middle seats and an aisle/window seat despite having requested and paid for the seat reservations 11 months ago. To make matters worse Prem Economy passengers had been bumped up to Club World and were enjoying A/B seats - total joke. Food was OK crew were friendly enough but I will never travel BA again due to the absolute neglect or consideration for their premium customers. Goodbye BA Executive Club and good riddance BA.

A Cox,0,JFK to Reykjavik to Stockholm. I never made it to Stockholm and after I was told I would not get there for two more days I decided to return to JFK. Customer service is nearly non-existent. If you don't mind how long it takes to get to your destination (could be days) this airlines may be a good choice.

Ahmed al zuhairi,1,DOH-DXB-DOH. Fly this route weekly. Amazing consistency. Flights on time. Easy boarding. Use a bus to terminal in DXB and DOH which means buying seats at the front is pointless. New planes. Widescreen IFE which is free on this short sector and works before takeoff and after landing. IFE costs $10 otherwise for unlimited movies and shows or $4 for shows only. Legroom is very cramped but is acceptable for short haul flights. Note there is a fast bag desk at DXB but is not very visible.,1/28/2015,4,2,5,5,5,10
A Souter,0,This airline seems to get worse with every flight I take. Have been loyally using Virgin for 23 years especially London to Tokyo for both business and pleasure. Upper Class on last two journeys has been appalling with old fleets to Cape Town and Tokyo. Not even On Demand system running the old style looping system instead. Upper Class get tablets but cumbersome to use and limited selections. Food poor and generally falling behind peers. Shame as I used to evangelise to all about Virgin's qualities but now I tend to recommend avoiding.,12/25/2013,2,2,2,1,4,2
A Craig,1,Travelled from Seattle to Stockholm and back via KEF. Planes are fine service is fine food and drink are exactly what you get these days on any airline. Entertainment system is better than most competitors. KEF is a small airport and they don't call out gate announcements so you need to pay attention. That isn't Icelandair's fault. I travel extensively and would use Icelandair again in a heartbeat. My only issue is that they cancelled their partner program with Alaska so I didn't get any points!,8/27/2013,5,4,4,5,4,9
Ahmed Dada,1,DUR-JHB-LHR return. FA's were proactive although some surly. Planes are old but well maintained and spacious. IFE is useless (no personal TV on some flights) but when you do get its fantastic. Out of 52 flights with SAA only 1 has been delayed.,8/20/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9

A Srisawat,0,TLV-BKK round trip. Flight was old and not comfortable. Service was non-existent on both flights. The tasteless food was given as if we were begging for it. When I asked for water from the crew it was also given in a similar manner. Apart from those interactions the staff was invisible throughout the flight. There was no on-board entertainment. Also we weren't able to hear anything the pilot said due to bad speakers. The toilet was filthy. Definitely not worth going through the excessive security and flying the longer route (to avoid other middle eastern countries) for such old plane and bad service.,7/13/2014,0,3,2,1,1,1
A Crawford,1,EY20 28th November and EY17 on 3rd Nov 2013. Would definitely fly them again everything was immaculate the crew at LHR/AUH and on the aircraft and the aircraft itself. I was sat in coral economy and had more legroom than any carrier I've been on in that class the IFE system was great brilliant selection of TV Films Music games and more. 3 choices of main meal in economy as well as snack service and obviously drinks. You may pay a little more but the service and the airline itself is definitely worth it.,7/12/2014,5,5,5,5,5,10
Ahmed Shihab,1,DHK-IST then IST-JFK. This was my first time with Turkish airline. Cabin staff were rude. On my first leg I ordered a glass of water twice but it never came I had to walk to the galley to get my glass of water. The food was served after 1 hour. It was an 8.5 hrs flight so me and my wife slept a bit after the meal was done. I took beef biriyani and my wife took grilled chicken. The chicken was really tasty unfortunately I choose the wrong meal. Then before landing we were served a sandwich which was good. On our 2nd leg IST to JFK (10 hrs 30 mins) it was an early morning flight which was supposed to take off at 7.30 but got delayed 45 minutes. First meal (scrambled egg with mushroom) was served immediately after take off which was tasty but the cabin crews were again disappointing. Again I ordered a cocktail but it didn't come the first time I asked for it. I would recommend this flight as its cheap.,2/3/2014,3,3,4,2,1,6
A Crociani,1,FCO-TXL-FCO. Both flights with A319 cabin crew nice and food service ok for 1hr 35min flight. Everything went smoothly and on the return we arrived 20 min ahead schedule. Will fly them again.,5/27/2015,4,4,4,0,4,8
A Starr,1,Myself and my husband recently travelled from Manchester to Cancun on the Dreamliner - TOM 144 26 October. The flight itself was great ie entertainment comfort and the cabin crew were very pleasant. We were absolutely disgusted though with the standard of food offered. The main meal was a chicken and rice dish which was awful but the teatime cheese and pickle ploughman's on some sort of bread was absolutely disgusting. It really turned my stomach and my husband refused to eat his as well. The flight was 10 hours long so I would have expected a better standard of food with the money we paid. On return TOM145 9 November - the food was not much better. The best part was the bacon sandwich for breakfast just before landing at Manchester. Thomson are letting themselves down.,11/21/2013,3,4,1,5,4,8
Ahmet Bayram,1,"We chose Qatar Airways for our trip to Phuket for our honeymoon. Our experience with one word: Excellent. Flight clean, staff friendly, service excellent and seats very comfortable. Ground service very good, and activities in Hamad International airport sponsored by Qatar airways was really nice. The onboard entertainment system was really good (especially selection of movies) games ok. ",7/22/2015,5,5,5,5,5,10
A Crociani,1,Rome-Fiumicino to Tel Aviv-Ben Gurion and return. Both flights of 3 hours with old Airbus A320 the cabin crew served a lunch on the outbound leg and a dinner at the return you could also take more drinks in the galley in the rear part of the aircraft. On the FCO-TLV leg we took-off 15 min. late but we arrived on time on the TLV-FCO route we took-off and landed on time. Nothing to complain I will fly Alitalia again.,2/21/2014,4,4,4,0,4,8
A Steffen,0,Business class AF0990 Paris Johannesburg on A380. Flight was fine and service as can be expected. However the business class seats of AF must be the worst in the airline industry. Cannot believe the manager responsible for buying these chairs is still working there. They must know by now that this seat is an affront to the travelers using them. While the whole competition and even their sister company KLM goes full flat AF decided to develop a chair which sets back time a least 10 years. I am very sorry for all the French travelers that have no other choice then use this airline. I definitely will never again.,11/10/2013,1,1,4,4,4,2
Aidan Clarke,1,VN 661 to Singapore. Flight left on time on the plane was clearly quite old but clean nonetheless. The middle seat between the other passenger and me was free so it added to the level of comfort. The meal was filling and quite tasty - when you fly around Europe and get little or nothing this makes such a nice change! The cabin was quite warm. The crew did several drink runs and were always available. Would fly with them again if I was in the region.,6/25/2015,4,4,5,NaN,5,1
A Crociani,1,FCO-LAX-FCO on a 777-200ER which was completely full in both flights fast check-in departure and arrival on time. The flights were calm and nice thanks to a good on-board entertainment system and a professional and friendly cabin crew which passed frequently offering beverages. the food was good two meals and many snacks and drinks with an open bar in the back of the plane.,7/1/2012,4,3,5,4,5,8
A Stevenson,0,Punta Cana - Gatwick. World Traveller Plus cabin on B777. I find this particular cabin very noisy possibly due to proximity of the engines. Seats are comfortable and leg room and elbow room significantly better than economy. The front row of World Traveller Pus has even more legroom but be warned that this is a mixed blessing since this row is fitted with shelves for strapping down babies cradles and if you sit next to a passenger who requires this facility then it will severely compromise your space. IFE was OK but nothing special. Main meal was OK but breakfast was an absolute disgrace; a dry cheese croissant and a small granola bar. No alternatives offered. I know this is not business class but for the premium I paid for World Traveller Plus I feel entitled to something better than this really very poor take it or leave it excuse for a breakfast. The drinks service was nothing special either; one round of juice or water before take off an offer of wine with dinner and another juice and water run after dinner. Then nothing until breakfast. Regarding the crew some were engaging and friendly but far too many others were offhand and unsmiling. When in all innocence I used a toilet in the Business Class cabin I found a member of cabin crew waiting for me when I emerged who promptly berated me for my mistake. Fair enough but when I explained that other passengers in World Traveller Plus had also used the toilets in Business Class I was virtually called a liar. I backed off from an argument but I found the experience upsetting and I simply couldn't get to sleep thereafter. I eventually disembarked at LGW hungry thirsty and a somewhat unhappy bunny. In summary World Traveller Plus is probably just about worth it for the extra comfort and space but don't get your expectations too high in terms of food and drink and be prepared for inconsistent inflight service.,5/31/2015,3,4,2,3,2,5
Aikawa Ichiro,0,I'm a Japanese tourist flown on Tokyo-Manila-Kalibo flight (MNL-KBO was with PAL) It was my first time flying with this airlines and I think I expected too much. The cabin crews were unfriendly and rude. This has been the worst airline I've flown with I felt like I was flying a LCC. The terminal in Manila was pretty small and congested.,4/23/2015,1,3,2,1,1,1
A Crowley,1,Perth to Mauritius return. Allowed to use Qantas club lounge at Perth which was good as usual. Lounge at Mauritius less impressive and completely full due to number of departing flights. IFE terrible (about 10 films with only one option suitable for children) but otherwise reasonable. Lie flat seats were at quite an angle but reasonably comfortable for short night flight on return leg. Food was better than anticipated. In flight service was reasonable and friendly. Make sure you stick on your 'do not disturb' sticker on a night flight otherwise the staff wake you for breakfast even if you're fast asleep; if you have pre-assigned seats make sure you ensure they've given you those seats at check in; pre-load your own IFE on an ipad or laptop!,11/3/2012,4,3,4,2,4,7
Ainan Binti Sulaiman,0,Inflight service from Kuala Lumpur to Skopje was great and only mediocre from Istanbul to Kuala Lumpur. I had a layover more than 11 hours at Ataturk Airport flying in from Budapest on 15 December 2013 Flight TK 1037 and my connecting flights the 16th at 0055 to KLIA. When I asked one of the airline staff at the transfer desk he said that I could get a hotel during my transit. I was then told to go the Turkish Airline Hotel Desk. The airline staff were very rude and told me that there was no hotel room for me. When I told him my wait was more than 10 hours he just waved his hands and never tried to answer any of my questions.,12/20/2013,3,4,4,4,1,6
A Crowley,1,We flew Malaysia Airlines from Kuala-Lumpur to Melbourne a few days ago and we were pleasantly surprised with the service they provided. The cabin crew were excellent. Constantly checking if you were OK. They all seemed very happy and cheerful. Inflight entertainment food etc are all basically the same in any airline but the crew can make the difference.,5/7/2014,4,4,4,5,5,10
A Stevenson,1,Gatwick - Cancun - Gatwick. This was in the new 787 Dreamliner. Premium Economy has a 2-3-2 configuration and a 36â€ seat pitch. All flights on time. Meals rather ordinary but drinks dispensed generously. A good selection of films and other entertainment on the IFE system stored in the armrest. Two toilets in the Premium cabin one in the forward galley and one at the rear of the cabin; on the outward leg I was rather brusquely asked to sit in my seat rather than wait in the galley for the toilet to become available this seemed a bit unnecessary and over assertive for the sake of it since I wasn't in anybody's way but other than that service was generally good. Regarding the Dreamliner cabin air is apparently of a higher quality than other aircraft due to greater cabin pressure and humidity difficult to say for sure how much difference this made but I disembarked both flights feeling in good shape. The cabin ceiling is comparatively high and the overhead baggage compartments are generously sized. A few issues though. As many others have noted there is a serious problem with the design of the seats / armrests; even with a 36â€ pitch if the person in front has reclined their seat then it's very difficult unless you have an aisle seat to exit your seat without climbing over the passenger next to you. Also although the aircraft have been in service less than a year the seats are already looking the worse for wear; some of the plastic trim in the armrests is coming loose some of the IFE screen mechanisms were also very loose (on the outward journey I noticed that someone had needed to jam bits of cardboard in the mechanism of my IFE system to keep the TV screen upright) and on the return journey the footrest on the seat of one of my party was jammed in the extended position. Finally although we were given a nice printed menu of all the beverages supposedly available on the return journey we were told that several of these had been withdrawn so the variety of soft drinks is actually rather less than Thomson were advertising. On the whole pretty good and I think the 787 sets new standards but for the extra we paid for Premium seats we expected a bit more.,6/2/2014,3,4,3,4,4,7
AJ Godfrey,0,"Jetstar ""Star Class"" is not worth it. Flew to Honolulu with Jetstar for holidays the tickets were not cheap but I think it was more premium economy at business class prices. No priority boarding. No priority baggage first off and last to get baggage. The all Thai cabin crew did not seem to have been well trained they were very friendly but the service was slow and haphazard. Some meals came out fast others really slow to arrive dessert of ice cream was liquid when it finally arrived. Food would be classed as average for economy on most airlines definately not what I would call ""business class"". Seats were not that comfortable and had lacked in legroom the seat in front hit my knees when reclined. Inflight entertainment of iPad took an hour to come out after departure and there was no place to hang it it was in my lap while I ate meal over the top of it. Not exactly classy. It was three times the price of an economy ticket and definitely not worth it. I am one very unhappy customer and will never fly Jetstar again.",4/26/2015,1,1,2,1,2,NaN
A Crowley,0,We flew from Colombo to Kuala Lumpur. The cabin crew seemed up-tight they had little interaction with passengers and were in a hurry to quickly get the job done and disappear. They collected the blankets approximately 1 hr before landing and left us in the cold.,5/7/2014,2,3,2,4,1,3
A Stijlen,1,CPT-DXB Boeing 777-300. Comfortable flight friendly and efficient cabin crew. Lunch & dinner serving outstanding. Staff made the flight as pleasant as possible. ICE inflight entertainment system with excellent choices.,5/20/2014,5,5,5,5,5,9
A Curran,1,3rd Sept flight AF185. Last year we travelled with Air France to Paris from Melbourne and as experience and price were good we did again this month. I do not understand the criticisms of this airline. Both our experiences have been excellent. Yes the seats are not lie flat but they were particularly comfortable for sitting. The crew on both occasions were extremely friendly and attentive the food and wine was of a high standard and entertainment had plenty of choices. We think this is very good value for money and will continue to fly Air France when we can.,10/1/2014,5,4,5,5,5,9
Ajay Garg,1,I travelled to South America and back in premium economy. Was quite apprehensive after reading various negative reviews. But to my surprise the flight the crew and service was excellent. The aircraft was good and the air hostesses were very efficient and polite. The seats were also very comfortable.,8/5/2014,5,4,3,3,5,10
A Storey,1,"GRU-DFW in new 773. What a great and enjoyable flight. New plane comfortable seats excellent food huge movie selection and a wonderful crew. If this is the ""new"" American they have got it right!",4/21/2014,5,5,5,5,5,10
A D Gravett,0,EZY5455 from Gatwick to Paphos Cyprus. I would rather fly in a coffin seats might be ok for short flights of say up to 2 hours but trust me when they rush you on a delayed departure flight already knowing your going to be delayed further due to military manoeuvres around Cyprus air space. Hurry rush sit down belt up. Oh this is your captain speaking we've just been informed our departure is going to be delayed by about 1 hour. Due to military manoeuvres over Cyprus airspace. So sat their we did in cramped conditions for an hour. Another 4 hours until we got to Paphos airport and finally released from the cramped conditions. Still got this to look forward to Saturday night.,4/12/2015,2,2,3,NaN,3,2
A Johnstone,1,EWR-YTZ. Delightful flight. Small lounge by the gate at Newark serving soft drinks and tea/ coffee. Friendly onboard service given with a smile. Arrival at the Toronto City Airport was simple - in my hotel less than an hour after landing.,10/16/2012,5,5,4,0,5,10
A Storey,1,ORD-AMS-AUH return. B747 and A330 aircraft in Economy Comfort. Extra space in Economy Comfort well worth it. Crews were all great and service was with a smile. Food was good and drinks while limited choice were OK. The Amarula after dinner was a nice touch. Inflight entertainment had good selection of films and music. Would definitely fly with KLM again.,11/7/2013,5,4,4,4,5,9
A D Storey,1,AKL-HKG and BOM-HKG-LAX. A340 from Auckland to Hong Kong has old coffin class seats. Still comfortable enough. A330 from Mumbai and B777 to LAX. Seats are very comfortable and easy to get some sleep. Crew were excellent on all sectors. The IFE selection was not as good as American B773. Overall great product and very consistent.,2/18/2015,5,5,4,3,4,10
A Jones,0,"This was my first transatlantic flight and it was miserable. Being 6'4"" the legroom was not nearly sufficient. Food wasn't worth the calories and lacked all flavor. Staff is indifferent and we left ORD 90 minutes behind schedule. I know it's become clichÃ© to hate on United but it Really is subpar. I've since flown Aer Lingus American Turkish British and KLM over the same route and all were better (American was a tie I'd say).",12/31/2014,3,1,1,3,2,3
A Storey,1,LAX-SYD return on A380 and SYD-AKL WLG-SYD on B737-800. Great service on all legs. Qantas knows how to make passengers feel comfortable in Economy especially in the long haul legs with the A380. Those who complain should pay some more money for bigger seats! Food drinks runs movie selection were all good. One catch for Oneworld travellers who use the Qantas codeshare flight on an Emirates plane. Qantas do not allow access to their lounges unless you are in Business or First even though you may be Emerald in the Oneworld system.,3/28/2014,5,5,5,5,5,9
A Su,0,SFO-Beijing-BKK flight in June 2013 and the service was mediocre. An old aircraft with 60-70 people sharing one big TV monitor. When we first got onboard it was very hot in the cabin the stewardess said its normal and once we were flying the temperature would cool down. The flight was late so I missed my connecting flight. I was placed into an airport hotel. On the last flight coming home there was water dropping from the overhead bin so the stewardess put tissues and napkins in between the gaps.,9/30/2013,3,1,1,1,2,NaN
A Sugrim,1,Flew to Casablanca from JFK return to JFK. Flight left 5 mins later than scheduled. Much better that most US flights. Plane while a little old was clean decent meal and reasonably friendly attendants. Entertainment needs to be looked at but was a night flight so sleep was needed. Arrived 30 mins before scheduled. Return much the same. Problem was at JFK. Waited 30 mins to disembark and another 30 mins for our bags.,3/20/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Jose,1,MNL-LHR-MNL in business class. We flew on PAL's new 777 but the cabin looks old. Both on the way to LHR and back to MNL the controls to the AVOD did not work. The headphones also had problems. Limited movie selection. The seats do not lie fully flat there is a slight angle. The food is good but the portions are small. On the way back they ran out of choices. On the LHR-MNL leg it appeared that the FAs were new on the job and appeared nervous were stumbling a lot and did not know how to properly serve.,6/20/2014,3,4,4,3,3,6
Ajizu Shiei,0,Singapore to Zurich. The overall service was poor flight attendants were rude and unprofessional. The flight attendant brought some puzzles books pencils and told my kids (11 and 6 years) that they were too old for these things and went away. My wife asked for water in the middle of night. The flight attendant was very annoyed and replied that she had just come around with water. During breakfast the flight attendant forgot to give my daughter bread when my daughter asked for bread the flight attendant told her to eat the rest of the food first and she would bring the bread later.,6/26/2013,1,2,3,3,1,NaN
A Sullivan,1,SFO-MNL-DVO-MNL-SFO. I couldn't have asked for more. Each flight I was on was excellent though I guess it all depends on what you expect. I expect to get to where I'm going as safely as possible in an aircraft that's worthy and has been cleaned and with pilots and crew that know what they're doing. Oh if there's some food and drinks fantastic. I'd fly with PAL again in a minute! Excellent!,9/17/2013,5,5,5,5,5,10
Akram El Dimerdash,0,CAI-ATH-CAI. Flight was on time ground handling efficient. The flight was operated by the small ARJ Aircraft the Crew was inefficient and rude. Meals were below average.,8/12/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,1
A D Storey,1,HKG-KUL-BOM. B737 from Hong Kong and B777 to Mumbai. 737 seats are comfortable and sufficient for the sector. B777 seats are totally outdated and need to be replaced. Food drinks and crew were great on all flights. First class lounge in KL is quiet and well served by staff. Malaysian are making an effort to recover from the horrors of last year.,2/18/2015,5,3,4,4,5,10
A Svensson,1,AMS-KBP-DNK. On AMS-KBP leg everything was on time and the cabin crew efficient and friendly. The meal was a sandwich and a choice of soft drinks however I requested the Kosher meal which was excellent. A full meal a hot chicken dish with rice bread vegetables and a salad along with some sweets. The KBP-DNK leg was fine as usual a 737-500 no meal aside from a tea coffee or water although its only a 50 minute flight so it's more than adequate. My luggage didn't make it to Kiev due to KLM as I connected in AMS from NWI but the agents traced my luggage as being in AMS straight away and as I was connecting on to DNK arranged for it to be flown on from Kiev when it arrived. I had it within 12 hours of arriving in DNK which I was very impressed with. I have always found UIA to provide an equal service to many western European airlines and wouldn't hesitate to recommend them.,5/28/2012,4,4,5,0,4,9
Akram EL Dimerdash,1,BHD-LHR. I flew BA from Belfast George Best Airport to London the flight was very good and on time and uneventful. The crew was excellent and the aircraft was a new A319. The fare was ok.,9/22/2014,4,3,3,1,4,9
A Joven,0,I've been a Qantas frequent flyer for a number of years now and fly with them domestic for the most part. For international flights I avoid them like the plague as they are expensive and the service is sub par. This particular flight was BKK-SYD and I was just relieved I was able to secure an aisle seat (with the added bonus of the spot next to me being unoccupied). Online check in was not available for this flight for some mysterious reason. The cabin crew need a lesson in grooming and customer service ASAP. All of them looked bored and somewhat angry. The service as usual was disinterested and disconnected. Breakfast was just thrown at the passengers. One of the ladies looked like she just rolled out of bed and one of the male attendants needs to shave so as one doesn't look like they've been awake for 24 hours. The food service was mediocre (as usual). Most notable was their 'breakfast' which was a small muffin yoghurt and orange juice. Please note that in their domestic flights (ie SYD-MEL) this is almost the same amount of food that's served. In a 9 hour flight with a 4 hour gap between the dinner and breakfast service one is left rather starving.,9/19/2014,4,3,3,3,2,6
Akram El Dimerdash,1,CAI-CPH. Flight was on time the Aircraft was a new 737-800. Economy class the service was very good the staff patient considering the number of school students onboard. FA's tried patiently to control them and keep them seated. BER CAI. Station Manager was extremely friendly to everybody. Flew Business class the flight was on time seats were old fashioned but comfortable and functional Video & Audio programs were excellent food was good quality and FA's nice and interacting with passengers.,8/13/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
A Swamy,1,BLR-BOM-RUH return. Flights to and from RUH delayed by 20 minutes. Aircraft's were quite clean but starting to show their age. No personal IFE on BOM-RUH which was surprising. Personal IFE on RUH-BOM had a decent selection of Bollywood and Hollywood movies. Cabin crew efficient. Snacks and breakfast good though portions are small. Quality of Indian dinner served is quite bad when compared to other Middle eastern airlines even though Jet is an Indian carrier!,7/9/2013,3,3,2,3,4,6
A Dada,1,Flew SA Express CPT-DUR and previously DUR-CPT-DUR. Crew have always been excellent. They are warm and friendly right from boarding where we are always greeted by a great smile. Food is good sandwiches for dinner with chocolate for dessert. A good selection of drinks were offered. Leather seats are very comfortable but are now showing some signs of age. Love flying SA Express because their planes always seem private and warm. Baggage was on the carousel quickly from deplaning. Overall three great experiences with SAX.,12/22/2014,0,0,0,0,0,10
A K Cusack,1,UIO-CCS. There were no problems to speak of nor was the experience extraordinarily positive. First off I should say that I had problems in booking via the Santa Barbara website and so had to visit their agency in Quito. I had my bags fairly thoroughly checked by migration people in Quito but that's understandable given the flow of drugs in the region. The flight itself was fine: Boeing 767 no obvious neglect crew were friendly enough food was decent. We did leave about 30 mins late. At the Caracas end our bags were slow in arriving. It seems that there are problems but you may get lucky and avoid them as I did.,7/28/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,7
Akram EL Dimerdash,1,"CAI-AMS, May 12th. AMS-IAD, May 14th: Check in went smoothly and fast through sky priority, the Lounge was perfect, but again overcrowded. For boarding Sky priority is not very good as we were placed in an adjacent seating area to the Economy and the boarding was altogether with everybody on the same buses. KLM crew was excellent, the greeting was a wide smile. We departed on time, the service was excellent. AMS-IAD: The airport was extremely crowded, the information desk directed me to the Sky priority check in for KLM, it was crowded but much better than the regular check in counter. KL Lounge was great and huge, so it was never over crowded. Boarding was
professional and very organized, it was A330 airbus that looked brand new and it was a pleasant flight. The day was spoilt with the endless immigration queues at Washington Dulles Airport, and an even longer one for the customs. It took me almost 3 hrs to pass all of this.",6/12/2015,4,5,5,4,5,10
A TÃ¸nnesen,1,From Alicante to Bergen on Dec 7th-13. As always: an attentive crew relaxed and efficient and with a touch of humour. Also good and reassuring information from cockpit about turbulence delays and the like. Tidy cabin and toilets leg-room ok. Web page and ticket reservations excellent. On-board WiFi very good. It's obvious that the airline over the years has put much emphasis on building a robust passenger-friendly culture. Given the recent press coverage about salary-cuts and increase of working-hours I think it's impressive that the crews keep up the good work as always. From long flyer-experience with Norwegian I've never noticed any negative fluctuations of the service-level.,12/10/2013,5,3,3,3,5,10
A Dan,1,DC to Addis return. Also took some domestic flights as well. Inflight entertainment was good and leg room not bad given to my height. Food was edible and we had several meals. Crew members were very nice and quick to answer call lights. Our domestic flights were very good compared to domestic flights in the US. Food was good and price very reasonable. ET needs lots of improvements when it comes to customer service.,3/1/2012,4,4,4,4,4,7
A Kant,1,TUL to SFB flight and back after a weekend. The main motivation to use this airline was the affordable price and a direct flight to desired destination. We did our homework and were mostly pleased. This airline asks you to sacrifice comfort and charges less for it. If you demand extra they charge you extra. Have your boarding pass ready and be at the airport early. Print out your boarding pass as early as you can to get the best seats it is very important if you would like to sit with the person on the same reservation. Pack light. We just used the carry on allowed bag that has to fit under the seat. This also allows you to go straight to your gate. All check in bags and bigger carry on ones will be charged extra. The seats do not move but bring your own neck pillow. They allow a lunch pack and I had it with me so did not have to buy any food on the plane. Well I did buy a can of ice tea for $2. Bottle of water was also $2. Make sure you have an acceptable credit card for that. Restrooms are free! I did not like that the flights I took were both late. 30 and 45min. Not sure why. Seemed like that the first flight had been placed with the different plane (new airbus) since the seating arrangements were off and the second flight had some turbulent weather. Second plane was really old Douglas 80. Staff were nice and helpful. People do forget that this airline is different and demand the same service as on other airlines. Then they get frustrated if they get charged. I think I will fly again with them.,4/7/2014,5,4,5,1,5,9
Akram El Dimerdash,1,HEL-STO June 3rd. Check in machines were not all working at Helsinki Airport so I had to go into the full process before the screen tells me to go and check in with the nearest agent. The flight departed with a 30 min. delay. The flight was full but the seats were comfortable the interior cabin was nicely decorated - all seats were dark blue leather. No meals you have to purchase everything but still I believe it is the Best Low cost flight I have had.,7/4/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,7
A Talley,1,I read so many bad reviews of Turkish I was a bit sceptical when I boarded. The flights we took were round trip from Houston to Istanbul. I was pleasantly surprised by the entire experience. The plane was comfortable with adequate legroom in economy. Very good inflight entertainment system. Food was excellent. We especially liked that snacks/drinks during the mid-flight time (after first meal and before second) were all self service. Very convenient. My only complaint would be the lavatory got messy fast and never really felt clean. Flight out of Houston was one hour late out of Istanbul was right on time.,5/6/2014,5,4,5,5,5,8
A Datti,1,Flew Istanbul to Izmir. The flight was on time and the plane was clean. Overall the crew was friendly. Even though the flight was only around 30 min we still got served sandwiches. Considering how cheap the flight was it was really worth it.,3/26/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,10
Al Brown,1,Have flown with Silk Air many times on the SIN-PNH route but have not wrote a review before. The service has always been good and plenty of leg room. The food and drinks are just right for this short 1hr 45min flight. The return to SIN this time was hampered by bad weather and we were delayed 15min landing but the pilot managed to keep clear of the worst and kept us informed. There is no in flight entertainment as such but I'm aware of this and have my ipod and book. Will fly Silk Air again.,9/24/2013,4,4,4,0,5,9
A Karmela,0,"Flight from Sydney to Singapore on Feb 21 2013 was 10 hours delayed no text message nor email prior to this and no offer of apology or any meal vouchers. Upon boarding passengers notice a lot of empty yellow seats in the middle whilst everyone was cramped seated right at the back then asked the crew to transfer to which they replied ""you have to pay extra A$68"". After all the taxes and their add ons fees this airline is not cheap. We missed our connecting flights hotel pick up and a night accommodation with no apology. Never again.",4/2/2013,1,1,1,0,1,NaN
A Davids,0,Flew Sydney - Beijing - London. Both planes were old tatty and cleanliness left a lot to be desired especially the toilets. Both flights were delayed. For the second flight the scheduled time of the flight from Beijing to London was changed at the last minute. No delay was mentioned anywhere in the airport. Nothing was communicated by the airline the time just mysteriously changed from 14.30 to 16.10. When the staff were asked about it they either pretended to not speak English or just didn't. No apology was issued on the flight. The plane was sitting at the gate for hours before the flight was due to take off so no excuses there. We already had an 8 hour stopover so the extra couple of hours wasn't welcome when our total journey time was already 30+ hours. The entertainment system didn't work at all on my seat - not good for an 11 hour flight. Didn't matter as I had my iPhone loaded up with videos / music except Air China won't let you use your phone on the flight even with flight mode switched on! The food was pretty rubbish and the aisles seemed narrow. I know you get what you pay for and I'm not a fussy person for but I won't be flying Air China again. I previously flew with China Southern from Sydney to London for a cheaper price and it was a much better experience.,12/29/2014,2,2,2,1,2,1
A Tasker,0,Sharm to Cairo day trip. After asking the tour operator who we would be flying with and being told Egypt Air we were not impressed when we found ourselves entering the tail of Air Memphis. I have to say I am not a nervous flier in the slightest but myself and my partner were genuinely fearing for our lives. The journey started off ok apart from the poor safety demo but landing was a different matter. Whilst looking out of the window at the scenery coming in to land I noticed planes and helicopters a good 100m to our right - and then a runway. This set alarm bells ringing but I just thought it must be a huge airport - however we were almost at the ground when we took off again! People were in tears and panicking all down the aircraft. We were in the air for another 40 minutes with the aircraft seeming to stall midair drop a bit then speed up on numerous occasions. Needless to say I did not want to get on the flight home that evening. We made it safely back to Sharm that night but I would highly recommend that nobody fly with Air Memphis - ever!,7/2/2010,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
Al Khalidi,1,7 Jul 2014 Aberdeen - Dalaman. Return 21 Jul 2014 Dalaman - Aberdeen. My 3 members family flew from Dalaman - Aberdeen. I arrived at the check-in desk only 30 mins before my flight due to a shuttle transfer mistake. The check-in desk was closed after talking to the check-in staff a few calls with security and the Pegasus captain I was checked in with 3 suitcases fast tracked through passport control security checks and boarded the plane 5 mins before take off. Check in Staff were not so friendly (no smiley faces) but very efficient. When I arrived at Aberdeen Airport I predicted that our luggage/cases would not make it until the next flight. What a surprise when we found our 3 cases were within the first 10 cases.,7/31/2014,5,5,3,2,4,10
A Kattula,0,Booked connecting flights MEL-SYD-OOL and OOL-ADL-MEL with 3-4 hour stopovers in Sydney and Adelaide via Virgins website as flights were actually cheaper than direct non-stop. Had plans to do things in Sydney and Adelaide. Trip was a disaster! At check-in in Melbourne was given another persons boarding pass despite girl checking my ID. Baggage labelled with other passengers name. I had to point error out and girl attempted to get bag retrieved. Promised it had been fixed. Luckily other passenger also going to Gold Coast as on arrival bag not on carousel. Found it at baggage services still with other passengers name on it. Meant I spent 45 minutes waiting for bag. Flight to Sydney delayed nearly an hour by fog but no delay information. No entertainment on any flight and food very poor! Has anybody actually been on a Virgin aircraft that has their mysterious entertainment system? A very small cold chicken pasta salad with a revolting chocolate mousse is not what I would call a Gourmet meal as Virgin describes it. Email then sent to my home address whilst away rebooking my flight home as direct at different time with arrival into Melbourne 5 hours before connecting bus home to regional Victoria. No phone call despite Virgin having my mobile number. Had to ring them to get flights changed. Would not put me back on flights I had booked and very insistent I flew on flight they wanted me to! Ended up being rebooked on flight via Sydney but still had to wait over 2 hours for bus. No way would they offer any compensation such as an upgrade to business class. Made to feel that it was all my fault. Sorry Virgin but you have a long way to go in Customer Service!,12/16/2013,1,1,1,1,1,2

A Davidson,1,Feb 18 2014: Lufthansa - LH1817 - Barcelona (BCN) to Munich (MUC). This segment was part of a five flight itinerary with United Airlines a review of which can be found under their name. This particular Lufthansa experience was as always superbly efficient on the ground in both Barcelona and Munich. Navigating airports at either end was a breeze and the embarkation and disembarkation process easy and smooth. The flight itself had both an on-time departure and arrival and the in-flight service was as expected superb and efficient as one would expect from Lufthansa. Always a treat to fly with Lufthansa and will continue to do so whenever possible.,2/20/2014,5,5,5,5,5,10
Al Trainer,0,The first and last time I fly Rouge. What a disappointment! My previous flights to Honolulu were on Air Canada not Rouge. When I boarded the Rouge jet in December 2014 I noticed there was no inflight entertainment. A 6 hour flight with no inflight entertainment? Air Canada should let travellers know that the 767's they fly to Honolulu have no inflight entertainment. Had I know this I would not have flown Rouge to Honolulu.,1/14/2015,1,1,1,1,2,1
A Tello,1,PTY-Santiago DR-PTY. Aero Republica recently changed it's brand to Copa Airlines Colombia. Professional flight attendants however very broken English efficient service. On return to Panama crew very patiently and professionally handled an extremely difficult business class customer. Pilots English very good and informative announcements.

Alain Girard,0,Flight supposed to be direct from Marrakech to Marseille. In fact flight Marrakech to Bordeaux (500 kms north of Marseille) then stop for 40 min blocked in the plane then flight Bordeaux - Marseille. 4hrs 15min instead of 2hrs 30min. No notice from Royal Air Maroc before plane registering (if they advised people could have taken Ryanair flight leaving around the same time!).

A Davidson,1,"Flight 3000 - Barcelona (BCN) to Las Palmas (LPA) taken on Jan 31st 2014. In general we were more than satisfied with the flight itself which actually left the ""gate"" (a spot where the plane was parked on the tarmac) a few minutes ahead of schedule. On boarding the aircraft we proceeded to store out luggage in the overhead bin above our seats in row 3 only to be promptly told this bin was for ""Excellence"" guests (ie: those sitting in row 1 of the aircraft) and that we would have to move our carry on back to the next bin. Funny thing was no one sat in row 1 on this flight so the whole exercise was a bit stupid. The aircraft itself was in the Iberia livery as Vueling appears to be a subsidiary of Iberia. An older Airbus 319 it was obviously in need of a bit of tender loving care. The seats we were seated in sagged almost to the floor which provided for a rather uncomfortable four hour ride to say the least. Furthermore the aircraft had not been groomed prior to our boarding and as a result we found used tissues stuffed in with the flight safety card and magazines. Not a great start. The on-board service was no more than satisfactory to say the least and we will leave it at that. For our comments on the return flight from Las Palmas (LPA) to Barcelona (BCN) on February 16th you can refer to the separate entry.",2/17/2014,3,3,3,0,4,7
A Kearon,0,GA716. My wife was due to fly Jakarta-MEL on a Sunday in Mid October. She was advised that her flight was changed to go via Denpasar. We are not complaining about the terrible delays nor the lack of English announcements. What we are complaining about is the totally disgusting state of the toilets onboard before we left Jakarta. Whilst it was economy class there is no reason that the facilities cannot be clean.,11/11/2014,3,3,3,3,2,2
A Telman,1,IAH-MSY-IAH economy. Both flights on time. Very short flights so only water and refreshments on offer but crew worked very efficiently. They did not charge for the bags on the return flight and I had two bags to check in with total of about 12kg overweight!,2/9/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Kellner,1,Travelling from Luxembourg you will first have to deal with the lack of a proper drop-off zone. This actually makes online check-in a bit useless. The short flight to Zurich is not very pleasant as I really don't like to be flown on those Avro planes. Service is ok for such a short flight even though there was a lack of standards like napkin with the drink or even a cup with the water bottle. They don't serve snacks in economy on a 40 min flight. Unusual for somebody used to the local carriers excellent service. Zurich airport is fantastic! Quiet well organised and nice to look at. The long haul flight to MIA was of good standard. IFE is slow and a bit old fashioned. Service and food was ok for a 10 hours flight. The two girls on our side of the plane were very friendly courteous and helpful. I have to point out the impeccable state of the restrooms throughout the flight! Arrival in MIA was hassle free as we were the only international flight arriving at that time (6pm) and all immigration officers were there only for Swiss. Return from LAX also no drop-off zone for baggage again pre- checked-in online. Treated ourselves to a paying upgrade into business class. The seats are nice and good. Not my favourite though. The food concept is ok and especially the service routine for breakfast was confusing to me: No information about the options on the menu card which makes it even harder to pick a choice from the service cart and it all was on demand. Espresso service is great! All of the cabin crew were really nice caring and friendly. The downturn was the 'maitre de cabine' who was rushing down the aisle with her service cart and lacked proper service enthusiasm and should have taken her team as role models. IFE again too complicated for me compared to LH and EY. Short hop to Luxembourg again uneventful but on an Avro-liner.,1/8/2014,4,3,4,3,4,8
A Thenayan,1,RUH-DXB-MRU and back. Aug 15 RUH-DXB left Riyadh on time at 9.25 pm on a 777-300 ER. Service was excellent and the staff were kind! There were a few food choices (it was a short 1.5 hr flight) and I think it was Chicken Biriani or Fish. I had the Biriani and it was excellent (but spicy!). The IFE was very good and kept me entertained. We arrived to Dubai and they gave us fast track cards but we didn't need that since we were transiting in DXB for about 3 hrs. DXB was very busy and noisy. Arrived to the lounge and it was packed with barely anywhere to sit! Finally found a place near the buffet but it was pretty noisy. Our flight to MRU left at 3.10am (on the 16th and again on time so EK are pretty good at being on schedule) on an A380. It was a pretty nice plane but I had a few problems with the cabin and seat. The mini bar on the left (or right depends on where you're sitting) of the seat is pretty bulky and makes the seat more narrow and quite uncomfortable to sleep as it's quite tight (but it was a flat bed so I'll give it points for that). Another problem was that the cabin for Business was huge! It barely felt like Business from the amount of seats in the cabin! I sat in the smaller cabin on the back so I didn't have the problem that much and it didn't affect the service of the staff but it makes Business less premium. Once again the IFE and food service were excellent. For the lounge in the back of the deck I really enjoyed that! On the return flight I left MRU in the evening so I didn't have to sleep on that flight (and it was pretty much the same thing but the cabin was much busier). I didn't go to the lounge in the DXB layover since it was from 12.00 am to about 7:00 am and I took a room in the airport hotel. The DXB-RUH flight was normal but the IFE was more outdated. I would say it was pretty good but there were a few flaws with the A380.,1/26/2015,4,4,5,5,5,8
Alain Kupferman,0,I have been flying with my wife who has problems walking and needs a wheelchair from Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur and return. Flights were on time with nothing adverse to report and a very friendly crew. What is annoying is the way AirAsia are managing to increase prices: additional fee for credit card payment additional fee for seats (I can agree to a supplement for seats with more legroom) but to have to pay an extra fee for any seat is something than even Ryanair has not (yet) considered how can you fly without a seat? Additional fee for wheelchair use (4 USD it means 16 USD for a return trip). If you consider all this the price is not too different from what you can get on regular airlines and this will be my choice next time.,3/14/2013,3,2,0,0,5,7
A Davidson,1,MAN-DOH-SIN-DOH-MAN. A330 first leg. Really comfortable seat but preferred 777 on second leg which was perfect lie flat seat and so much roomier. Staff were excellent and couldn't do enough - very polite and attentive. Good Oryx system great headsets and good choice of films. Food excellent and as much drink as you like. The only disappointment was the 'fast track' luggage. Most of economy had left the airport whilst business class were still standing at the conveyor waiting for theirs 40 minutes later!,9/5/2013,4,5,5,4,5,9
Alain Kupferman,0,Bangkok via Addis Ababa to Harare and back in business class (if this can be called a business class). Out of the 4 legs 3 were flown on old aircraft's with outdated business class seats (no entertainment malfunctioning antiquated seats reasonable food and friendly service. Return flight from Harare to Addis was late whereby this seems to be a constant feature. All in all considering that the prices are low a reasonable alternative but not to be repeated too often.,2/26/2013,4,1,3,1,4,6
A Davies,0,I took a flight from Las Vegas to London 3 months ago. Virgin is on a clear downhill path. The cabin and seating configuration is very much style over substance it just does not work ergonomically. Too cramped and irritating 'intelligent' lighting. The seat remains far too clever for its own good resulting in electronic and mechanical glitches on almost every flight I have taken over the past 18 months or so. Main problem though is the cabin crew who for some reason behave these days as if they are doing you a favour. The one exceptional element of this airline at present is the departure lounge at Heathrow which is peerless in my view.,1/3/2014,1,2,2,2,1,1
A Kendall,1,We flew from Abu Dhabi to Phuket with two little ones. Flight was a bit shaky due to monsoon season nothing that captain could do about it the aircraft was new clean food was fine crew very attentive especially the young male attendant on the way back who was superb. The seats were fine too but when the person in front reclined his seat there was unfortunately not much space to move especially with the little one on your laps. Overall it was very pleasant experience and we will fly with Air Berlin again.,8/26/2014,5,3,4,4,4,9

A Thompson,0,Travelled DRW-SYD 16/1/14. It was our daughter's birthday so we upgraded our economy seats (row 4 - what a mistake) to business with hard earned FF points. Refurbed seats - mine would not work at all daughter's worked after assistance. I could've moved but I wanted to sit with my husband. FAs were pretty good reasonably attentive but our kids were asleep when breakfast was served and when they did awake they were not offered anything not even a water or juice. Our breakfast was appalling. I am gluten free but instead of getting GF bread I was given rice cakes! Cold eggs cold beans cold tomatoes. No bacon no sausage. No fruit no yoghurt. Overall the trip was bad we were really disappointed.,1/31/2014,2,1,1,4,3,4
Alan Bray,1,Travelled from Gatwick to Dalaman on 11th August 2014 flight number TOM862 with Thomson Airways on a 767-300 flight there and back on time crew very polite and flight deck crew kept us up to date.

Unlike Air Asia Tiger Air and Jetstar (all are low cost carriers in Asia) we found XL France website the least interactive with customers. Our attempts to communicate with XL France to purchase two seat upgrades met with a ""wall"". We had to get friends in Paris to talk to them. Otherwise food in Premium economy was good. What saved. The day was a stewardess who was very professional with her excellent service to all. Leaving today 2013 for Paris fm Cancun and am told by XL I can only purchase an upgrade at the airport. So it means leaving early to wait in queue. You wished XL France could be more customer friendly.",2/4/2013,4,4,4,2,3,3
Alan Chen,0,First time on this new airline to Chengdu from HK. Embraer used on this flight was quite new with decent legroom. Flight departed on time. Hot meal was served and taste average.

I would recommend this airline to passengers who travel from HK to mainland China.,3/28/2007,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Thompson,1,Gatwick to Marrakech and back. Bag drop was fast premium security slow (not BAs fault). Faultless calm boarding on time and a great flight with good service and refreshments. Return flight bag drop even better departure a little late due to a technical problem the 737s are getting on a bit. Again great inflight service and only a little late. Bags arrived as we got to the belt. Am very glad we chose BA for a 3 hour flight. Really good.,10/28/2014,4,4,4,1,5,9
A de Gruiter,0,2nd time flying with Etihad and found that the seats are getting smaller legroom disappearing and squashing in as many people as possible into the plane.

A Kiely,0,"After a 6 hour delay originally attributed to a broken air conditioning component estimated to take ""45 minutes"" to fix myself and several other passengers changed our tickets to another later flight to the same destination. After being boarded on that second aircraft we were informed that the ""maintenance log had been removed from the aircraft and not returned as expected"" so we would need to wait until it was located. Initially this appeared to be mere incompetence but swiftly came to seem like subterfuge. Fully an hour later we have just been told there is a panel on our aircraft that has to be replaced. This is supposed to take 1 hour. Meanwhile our original aircraft remains grounded without further explanation. As a passenger I am apprehensive flying on aircraft in such poor repair and moreover feel deceived repeatedly by gate agents and flight crew who are either misinformed themselves or deliberately trying to hide the sorry state of American's fleet. This will be my last flight on American were I not attempting to attend a family wedding I would deplane now.",9/1/2014,2,3,3,2,2,1

A de Windt,1,I have flow Curacao-Valencia / Valencia-Curacao several times. I don't have much to complain about. The flight's usually didn't have delays and most of the delays were at Valencia where local authorities decided to increase security at the airport causing delays in flights. Aircraft's look old (MD-82) but they are comfortable and clean and the crew are friendly. We didn't have food or drinks inflight I suppose it's because the CUR- VAL route is only a 30 min flight.

A Toye,1,Travelled with my wife from London to New York mid Sep 2013. Found 1st class to be a very cost effective alternative to the major airlines on this route. Checked in online and printed out our boarding passes. Check in was smooth and the staff pleasant. Proceeded to the Gulf Air lounge which was pleasant and served a variety of hot and cold dishes and alcohol. Flight was delayed an hour without any announcement or communication from the airline. Staff at the gate were not particularly enthusiastic but boarding was swift and we boarded through the priority lane. Onboard 1st class was clean and looked well maintained though old style. The green fabric seats were clean good size and comfortable but old style and not full sleeper. Seats were sufficiently spaced out. The crew were professional and polite but did not appear friendly or as jovial as major airlines. Offered pre-flight drinks accompanied with smoked almond nuts dates and Arabian coffee. Shortly after take off we were offered drinks and some hors d'oeuvres. Offered portable videos toiletry/vanity pack encased Parker style roller ball pen (souvenir) blankets and neck support cushions. 2hrs into the flight we were served a 4 course meal. The rest of the flight was smooth. Arrived into New York 30 minutes behind schedule. Our luggage came out first as they were priority tagged. Our return journey departed New York on time the check-in was seamless the lounge was good the food great the crew were same and we arrive London on schedule. Overall a good experience.,9/26/2013,5,3,5,3,4,8
Alan Dhana,1,I flew business class from CGK-IST-AMS overall it was a great experience but unfortunately it was not very memorable. The seat itself was great and comfortable the cabin layout was modern and clean however I found out that the cabin crew seemed to be inconsistent. They did not really interact with the passengers less smiles and seemed to lack manners. On the other side indeed there were the dedicated cabin crew who were willing to care and serve the passengers. My verdict is THY is still great airline to fly but it is not really that consistent compared to other airlines.,10/1/2013,4,5,4,4,3,7
A Debree,0,We flew with Precision Air from Zanzibar to Kilimanjaro and 2 weeks later from Kilimanjaro to Nairobi. For the first trip (Zanzibar via Dar es Salam to Kilimanjaro) we got up at 4.45 am to get our early flight. After waiting for a long time at the airport we heard our flight at 7.40 am was cancelled and that we were put on the next flight from 12.10 pm.â€¦ Not a very nice message to convey to 3 young kids who are looking forward to starting a safari adventure. According to our original schedule we would arrive in Kili at 11am according to our new schedule at 17.00hrs! As compensation we were each given a bottle of cola. The transfer time in Dar would have been more than sufficient for a copious lunch however the terminal the national flights only has one small snack bar. Anyway this is Africa so you cannot expect too much in addition we were on holidays so we spend some money in the airport bookshop and patiently waited. After some very unclear messages via the intercom our patience was challenged again: Our flight to Kili was delayed. Total confusion in the lounge as it was unclear until when it was delayed. I went to the ground staff and told our story of getting up at 4:45am and the fact that almost 12 hrs later we were still in Dar. She then told me that she was surprised that we were on the 7.40 flight as this flight had been non-existent for 3 months. How could we have reserved it on the Precision website less than 3 months ago? Eventually we got there. If you have to fly with Precision prepare for the massive disconnect between the attitude of ground and flight staff and the Precision slogan: â€you are why we flyâ€. Their planes are OK but especially cabin staff is selected on unfriendliness and arrogance.,8/20/2014,2,1,1,1,1,1
A Kirk,1,Our second trip travelling with Allegiant and for the most part we are happy with our flights to first Hawaii and now San Diego. However travelling from San Diego on April 20 we were concerned with the lack of communication about gate location. Since we printed the boarding passes the night before we expected no firm boarding gate at that time. When we arrived at the airport without checked in baggage we went directly through security as we usually do. However past security on the airport monitors there was no reference to our flight at all. All other airlines had the gate and time of departure clearly listed. We walked the airports 40 plus gates looking for any indication of which gate we should depart from. We then asked airport staff and they could only suggest we find an Allegiant agent which we could not. Again all other airlines were clearly provided with gate and departure time but not Allegiant. Finally we called Allegiant customer service and were on hold for 30 minutes. The person we finally talked to was after some delay was able to provide a preliminary gate assignment but suggested it might change. When we finally did find it even the monitor at the gate indicated gate closed. Rather than relaxing before our flight the time past security was quite stressful and at time we wondered whether we were at the right terminal. Communication is very important to passengers. All it would likely taken was a quick call the airport staff to get the monitor situation corrected. We will fly Allegiant again.,4/22/2014,4,3,0,0,3,5
Alan Dron,1,Cologne/Bonn to London Stansted. Check-in straightforward. Flight delayed by 90 minutes explanation given on board that planned aircraft had been unserviceable and replacement had to be found. Mildly irritating but fair enough. Ticket included a pre-paid snack that consisted of roll with some of the thinnest sliced meat I have ever encountered but what do you really expect these days on a low-cost carrier particularly on a short hop? Flight notable for large proportion of business travellers. Cabin crew friendly and efficient ticket just about reasonable price.,5/25/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,6
A Tsiorba,1,I had a great flight. I got bumped up to Premium Economy class the airplane was clean and new. The stewards were very professional. The food was great! the fed us 4 times!

A Dellapianne,1,Beirut to London. Quick and efficient check-in with friendly staff. The meals in Business are well prepared and plenty. The Cabin crew are friendly. The best thing is that you do not have cabin attendants treating passengers like children with their over obsessive and disturbing multiple checks on seat belts and hand luggage. In my opinion their policy on non-reclining seats is best. If you wanted to sleep - buy First Class where you get yourself a bed- seat.,9/8/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,10
A Klick,0,I have never felt more like cattle than on our trip FRA-HOUSTON on 1/6. Very crowded cabins with seats too close on the Airbus 380-800. Seats cannot be reserved ahead tried every way possible spent ages on it. Check-in online with actual access to seat map that allows you to chose your seat would make a lot of frequent flyers of all categories much happier. Flight attendants are overwhelmed with issues because of the random automatic system booking. Families are scattered all over the plane. Even after take off there were still people trying to reunite. This mess causes people to try frantically to reserve seats from 3 days before until past the door closures why in the world does Lufthansa want to have their personal overwhelmed with this problem is a mystery they lost my trust.,1/14/2015,2,1,4,4,5,2
Alan Fitter,0,"I haven't flown with this airline for 8 years. Seating much better than in past. Staff look smarter but still old easyJet poor staff attitude, herded on and fed the expensive usual.

A Tucker,0,"Hobart - Melbourne - Perth. Hobart to Tullamarine on a fairly new A320. Aircraft was pretty clean and tidy and me and my wife got our allocated seats. Flight was on time happy to say. JQ968 Tullamarine to Perth was a different story. Check in manager very rude even after I produced my ASIC and advised her that I was fully aware of the conditions of being in an exit row. Inexcusable behaviour. Flight was out on time on a new A320 but I cannot understand the cabin crew. A person should not do a job like this if they are not cut out to do it. Sure the flight was a ""red eye"" and as a frequent flyer I can accept that this can affect your moods. But the fact that one staff member (Cabin Manager) was putting meals on the floor another male member of staff (who conveniently wore no name tag) was slamming around and making as much noise as he possibly could. He was on a mission not to let passengers sleep. And then the lot of them standing there and complaining about their jobs - well you get the picture. Paid a full fare for this flight and in my view if this is the way Jetstar operates their business they do not deserve any of the domestic market. Will never use them again.",1/17/2014,1,3,1,1,1,1
A Denison,1,LHR to Philadelphia. Good catering. Very full flight. Pleasant cabin crew. Touchscreen was a bit unresponsive at times but all in all not bad for 8 hour economy flight. Unfortunately ended up with a middle seat.,1/13/2014,4,4,4,3,5,8
Alan Gurevich,1,"First Class on a 787 from Guangzhou to Vancouver. Airport check-in was good. The China Southern Lounge is far below the standard for 4 star airlines. It is very small and only has tables and chairs. There is food available including 2 freshly made hot dishes to order. The beverages are average. This is not to say that it is not comfortable and there is wif-fi. But compared to what I would consider 4-star ""standard"" such as ANA United etc. is does not come near that. There is only one row of First Class seating on the 787 and the seats were semi-pod. They did go fully flat and were comfortable for sleeping though if you are over 6 ft. tall you might find them a bit short. In the non-bed position they were comfortable though they do not really have foot rests - the leg rests stop mid-calf. There is a small shelf at the far end of the pod that does work so I would say the seating is quite adequate. VOD was in my opinion quite good with a large selection of Hollywood European Asian and Chinese films and lots of TV music and games options. The only negative is that the screen is fixed at the opposite end of the pod from the seat so it's a bit far away. The English proficiency of the cabin staff is not great so asking for anything that isn't in a narrow band of expectations can lead to confusion or your not getting what you wanted. This was as basic in my case as asking if they had any type of drinks beside red and white wine. Ends up they did but it took the purser to recognize my request. She then provided an extensive list of the drinks available on board which was very good. The food was good as well - no complaints. The staff was also quite attentive and ready to please. If you care about the sleeping suit I found it sized quite small. Overall a good experience which I would recommend and repeat if the routing called for it.",8/13/2014,4,4,3,4,3,8
A Konstantinou,0,Athens-Bangkok via Cairo. The reason for flying with Egypt Air after 10 years was the low price for this flight and the fact that now is a Star Alliance member. But everything is the same like before except the new logo on the aircraft and the Star Alliance logo everywhere! Athens-Cairo was an A320 in a good condition with a lot space for the legs. On arrival at Cairo airport we had 6.5hours for the connection flight. We were informed from their office in Athens that we had transfer to hotel for these hours. I went at their office and an inpolite employee told me to give a ticket for going upstairs at the restaurant for eat something. I asked the hotel saying that this was the deal buying the ticket and it is not possible stay at the restaurant for 65 hours. He answered saying that the time for to fix the visa is about 2 hours and after that I'll have short time at the hotel. After 30 mins they eventually took us out without visa and passport! The hotel was great nice lunch and room. The time we had to go back there was nobody from egypt air to call us. By ourselves we found minibus from the hotel to take us back to the airport. Cairo-Bangkok was on a tired B777no personal tv main screen with a bad view and no sound at most parts. This airline needs big steps for to be equal or near to the other Star Alliance members and really I wonder how Star Alliance decide which airline will join this group.,9/17/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,4
A Descrieres,1,CDG-MCT-BKK and return several times per year on Oman Air. Flight experience varies from fair to very good depending on the attitude of the flight attendants. Quality of food has gone down slightly in the last few months (no more menu cards and crew does not know precisely what they serve ). Transit in MCT smooth and efficient in spite of the bus transfer. Will continue to fly Oman Air because of the generous seat pitch and the benefits of their Sindbad frequent flyers programme.,12/18/2014,4,5,4,4,3,8
A Turner,1,Flew economy from Frankfurt to Singapore. Food was decent leg space sufficient. A very smooth flight with good customer service. Our flight out of Frankfurt was delayed due to bad weather in New York missed our connecting flight from Singapore to Perth as a result. We were very impressed with their service in this situation. They organised a room and paid a return taxi fare to the very nice Hotel Village Changi. We spent most of our 10 hour wait there eating the free buffet meals and resting in the comfortable room. Although we were frustrated that we were so severely delayed having a hotel room and meals provided made the situation less stressful.,1/9/2014,5,4,4,4,5,8

A Dhuka,0,"I was flying from Miami - Sao Paulo on AA929 on the 10th July 2014 on a 772ER in First. Having arrived from LAX 2 hours prior I was absolutely exhausted and was hoping to get some sleep on this leg. Boarding was smooth and the flight took off on time once the aircraft had reached cruising altitude and the seat belt sign was turned off I made my way to the galley and requested one of the two FA's (both were busy discussing their personal problems rather then attending to passengers) to turn down my bed I received a shocking impertinent response from her: ""So you want me to push a button for you"". Disgruntled and furious I prepared the bed myself and slept for the remainder of the flight. Around an hour before landing I was poked and woken up by the same rude flight attendant. At that point I expressed my frustration and told her she was not fit for purpose and shouldn't be working customer service orientated role. American Airlines has a good product in First (for a North American airline) I managed to sleep comfortably; however their poorly trained rude staff make it an unpleasant experience. Upon completing my flight I cancelled my return with AA and subsequently purchased a new flight with TAM which has a far superior product and customer service it's a shame they're suspending their first class on all routes from early next year.",10/22/2014,1,4,2,1,1,4

A Tyler,0,I flew from Honolulu to PHX and PHX back to Honolulu. I was very disappointed with this airline my first impression was horrible. Going to PHX from HNL the flight attendants on US airways were very rude and unprofessional. The aircraft that services HNL is always the 757. It was very squashed no wifi 3 by 3 seating configuration on the left and right side thus no room to move around. The interior of the plane was falling apart tray tables did not at all stay in the lock position. Lighting everything seemed out dated. Meal service was horrible you have to pay for meals where as on Hawaiian Airlines all meals are complimentary. Coming back from PHX to HNL flight attendant and customer service was very outstandingly rude. We were delayed 1 hour because we had to wait on a US air flight attendant who was late. This is unacceptable.,12/9/2013,3,1,4,2,1,NaN
A Krummacher,1,BKK-RGN on A319 leased together with crew from Air Mediteranee. Spotlessly clean plane but the leg space is just horrible so cramped (tall passengers will really suffer)!

Alan Hunt,1,"Southampton to Guernsey return - usually made on FlyBe but we wanted to change having been increasingly unimpressed by FlyBe's use of additional charges which make their ""bargain"" fares poorer value. Blue Islands' price was all inclusive comparable in total costs and offered a really impressive service in the face of adverse weather conditions. We were due to depart early on a fog-bound April Friday morning with a ferry connection we had to meet by 4.15pm at the latest. First flight was cancelled due to fog but second noon flight was swiftly re- arranged luggage transferred all with minimal fuss and still within the desired time window. We arrived in time to lunch on Guernsey and made our connection - wonderful service unlike that of their larger competitor which cancelled a similarly timed early morning flight and were unable/unwilling to ""rescue"" friends in time to make the same ferry. We had a fabulous weekend on Herm - they eventually arrived on Saturday missing half their break. Our return flight left early and arrived early with equally impressive service including the excellent Blue Island lounge at Guernsey. We have already booked our next flight with them and will seek to use Blue Islands whenever possible in future.",4/5/2009,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,5
A Dickson,1,BNE-SYD-LAX JFK-LAX-BNE. Would recommend flying Virgin Australia. International flights were comfortable and was able to get decent sleep for a couple of hours with the use of the travel pillow blanket and sleep mask. I was served 2 main meals and 2 snacks on the international flight and received them earlier than other passengers because of dietary restrictions. Food not flash but edible enough. Cabin crew could not be more helpful and attentive. The pilot on return from LAX kept us updated on the extreme turbulence we experienced for the majority of the trip which was calming. Excellent array of in flight entertainment. International flights weren't sold out which meant I could lie down across 2 seats. Check in and arrival was smooth. No delays. Aircraft comfortable spacious and quiet. Have booked Virgin Australia again for my holiday to Fiji and always fly with them for domestic flights with no dramas.,2/20/2014,5,4,3,5,5,10
A Krummacher,0,BKK-CGK-BKK on A320. I must say I was quite disappointed with the product. Plane quite old seats stained (brown anyway so you could only see the worst stains) but at least AVOD. Food was tasteless needed some salt and pepper but alas not available! Limited selection of alcoholic drinks (beer and wine only). Both times plane left 30 mins later but arrived more or less on time. Wasn't worth all the extra money as compared to LCC.,5/29/2013,1,3,2,4,3,3
A Ucfaaay,0,Flew LHR-TUN in Feb 2014. The flight out was delayed over 4 hours. I believe this was a combination of the British weather and Tunisair but no information was provided beyond being told at check-in the flight would be delayed by 1Â½ hours. Meal vouchers were provided 1 hour before boarding but by that point I'd already paid for a meal. Flight was OK but vegetarian food was inedible. Return flight was delayed by about one hour. Again no information provided. The vegetarian meal was the same as the flight out ie inedible. The price was cheap but arriving into Tunis at 02h00 was sub-optimal.,3/3/2014,3,3,2,0,4,5
Alan Krawec,1,SIN-NRT in Economy on May 26. Efficient boarding. Pushed back 10 minutes early. Friendly service but extremely average food. Good IFE. An okay experience but not as good as ANA and nowhere near as good as Singapore Airlines.,5/26/2014,4,4,3,4,4,7
A Valdivia,1,Had to take an unplanned flight with 30 family members to ZAC (Zacatecas) from TIJ (Tijuana). Tijuana International Airport is very nice. Security is pretty stringent. They have a couple of check points with army officers. Check in was not the best but we made it on the plane on time. The plane was an A320. Clean. On- board staff nice. They handed out alcohol soda water and chips. The flight was smooth and arrived at ZAC on time. Check in on the return flight from ZAC to TIJ was not good. They apparently sell some sort of fast pass check in which delayed those that did not want to pay for that service by about an hour as they got first priority. We made it on a packed plane. Flight crew was great. Arrived on time. I would fly them again. They are very reasonably priced and offer great service.,8/30/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
A Dillaway,0,"Spirit Airlines is the worst airline we have ever traveled on. This was our first and will definitely be our last time we will ever travel with them. You have to pay for everything; seat assignment Carry-on bag checked bags; any drinks or snacks on board. No complementary water no free coffee no free soft drinks. Everything has a price. I'm surprised they don't charge to use the toilet? If you don't prepay for your carry-on bag on-line you get charged $100.00 for it at the terminal. We saw several people discover that when they were in line to board the plane â€“needless to say they were very upset! There is basically no leg room at all. I am about 5â€™-8â€ (short by todayâ€™s standards) and I had only about 2 inches of room between my knees and the seat back in front of me. On 3 out of the 4 of the planes we traveled on the seat-backs were locked in one fixed position with no adjustments available -â€“ great for ones back on flights of over 3 and 4 hours particularly for seniors? Or outgoing flight from Oakland CA went smoothly until we got to Chicago IL for our connecting flight to Ft. Lauderdale. We had flight delay of over 3 hours and finally arrived at our destination in Ft. Lauderdale FL at 1:00 am too late for the free shuttle to our hotel. It cost us $50.00 to get another shuttle. If you don't down-load your boarding pass on-line you have to pay extra for it at the terminal. After downloading your boarding passes on-line the heading of your boarding pass states ""Congratulation! You are eligible for Fast Bag Drop"" Then it goes on to state that customers wanting to check bags must do so 45 minutes prior to scheduled departure time. n our return flight from Ft. Lauderdale FL our shuttle dropped us off at the terminal with 1 hr. 15 min. to spare before our scheduled flight. The problem with that is when you arrive at the counter for ""Fast Bag Drop"" there was only one agent handling that and the line was like a Disney World line waiting for a popular ride. There were about 6 other agents waiting patiently for customers who had to pay for their checked bags; carry-on bag and boarding passes. My wife and I who are over 70 year old seniors attempted to use one of these ""observing agents"" to give them our bags and was directed to get back in the long curving line. I questioned where the â€œFast Bag Dropâ€ is and was totally ignored. Spirit should rename it to â€œSnail Pace Bag Dropâ€ which would be far more appropriate! On 2 of our 4 flights we had to listen to an annoying lengthy sales pitch by the flight attendants who were attempting to get customers to sign up for Spiritâ€™s frequent flyer Master Card. I should point out that two positive things about Spirit Airlines are that the flight attendants were mostly friendly and polite and our checked bags arrived safely with us at our destinations. Spirit Airlines advertises itself as the first no frills airline and I must congratulate them on that -â€“ they most certainly are!",5/21/2014,1,1,1,1,1,1
A Kuchta,0,Well my trip started out with a fabulous connecting flight from Miami to Madrid and then from Madrid to Italy. The attendants were all so courteous like wise on the way the home. Except for the little fact as to they lost my luggage. Now I understand we are all human and luggage does get lost but what I do not understand is why they do not believe in customer service (a.k.a. returning phone calls or being polite). Not only did they just loose my luggage but once they had located it in the Madrid airport they sent it to Miami to be delivered to me that night. Another problem my luggage was never delivered to me as promised. So again more and more calls and still no call back until finally they responded with Ma'am your luggage is in Havana Cuba. The Customer service is awful and I will not fly with them again.,6/22/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
Alan Mackenzie,1,CPH-LHR-CPH October 2014. Air travel just keeps getting better. The latest boon on BA is the mobile phone boarding pass app. Wonderful. No more searching for a printer making life so much easier. Well done BA!,11/25/2014,4,4,3,1,4,9
A Kumar,0,SIN-DEL Check-in and boarding were quick and flawless. 30 minute delay due to some maintenance checks although captain kept us updated. Onboard A330-200 was in a good condition with a modern cabin complete with large PTV screens new recliner style seats in economy large bins and mood lighting. Seats were at the wider end of the spectrum and legroom quite generous. AVOD entertainment system with large PTV screens was quite good with a wide choice movies. Dinner had 3 choices alcoholic beverages and soft drinks however were limited in choice. Most significant was the cabin crew. Although not rude they seemed committed to doing the bare minimum. Hardly visible during boarding and one quick meal service after that they were invisible for 6 hours. During service they were expressionless and did not seem very comfortable communicating with customers even though they had a reasonable command of English. Overall a very competitive hardware but lets itself down on the soft product.,4/24/2012,2,4,3,4,2,6
Alan Mackenzie,1,CPH-FCO-CPH. Norwegian is one of the better no-frills carriers. Their web-site is easy to use and prices are reasonable for add-on extras - seat reservation checked luggage etc. Purchases onboard are very expensive however so you would be wise to buy any food beforehand. Our flights were on time the passengers dealt with in an orderly fashion and the aircraft very modern 737-800 series - clean inside and out. The cabin crew were friendly and professional. The only drawback is not being able to check-in on-line.,9/24/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
A van Galen,0,AMS-BCN VY8301 3 April. Return BCN-AMS 6 April VY 8306. We flew Vueling before with not much issues. This time the checking via the website did not work website down all the time. The mobile app does hang as well. We were informed few days before the flight of half an hour delay. Then for the flight back from BCN to Amsterdam we experienced another 2 hours delay including an hour in the plane. Staff were rude and uninformed and refused to give their name. We arrived two and a half hours late. Customer service reply was sorry nothing we can do. The return flight was operated by an airline called Avion this was not mentioned anywhere on documents or communication Avion is even worse then Vueling in terms of staff and service. All in all appalling service.,4/10/2015,2,2,1,1,1,2
Alan Madison,0,JFK-GRU-LHR. Unable to get on any US carrier out or BA back I had no choice but to go TAM. I'd flown previously with them within Latin America and hoped things would be better long haul. Now Oneworld they have a lot to do to meet that standard. At JFK they didn't recognise my Emerald status. Eventually got into the right American lounge usual there. The plane boarded very late. But with no announcements so 90 mins at the gate standing. Queues were chaotic. Lots of staff ignoring passengers. On board got champagne just as well as we waited a further 50mins to take off. They held the flight for two very late passengers in Business class. Surprised me until when they arrived it was obvious that they were off duty crew! Seats are very poor. Not only do they go nowhere near 180 degrees but they are far from flat. Extremely uncomfortable. If you end up in the middle seat of three you are in for a very bad flight indeed. AVOD screen large but they should have spent the money on seats. Food mediocre. GRU the usual chaos on landing late. On the London leg the lounge at GRU is appalling. Nowhere near enough seats for everyone few sockets for chargers. Many people standing like it was a bar. Too hot. Drinks selection OK. Boarded late again after a lengthy wait standing. On board experience similar. I fly long haul 50+ times per year. Ok I am careful about which airlines I use but this as bad a Business Class long haul experience as I have had. TAM not a patch on LAN. Avoid if you can.,5/1/2014,1,1,2,2,1,2
A Kupferman,1,Paris to Beijing in business class on a 777-300 and return from Shanghai to Paris in business class on A340. Seating on the 777 is excellent with new seats large TV screens and a 2-2-2 configuration. On the A340 the configuration was the same but there were older seats smaller TV screens though I cannot complain about seating. On both legs staff were friendly and attentive. What is disappointing was the quality of the meals. I have seldom tasted such bland food and the presentation was horrible. Before take-off only orange juice and water were served. Wines (good selection of French wines) were excellent but must have been very expensive because there was no second serving nor were liquors offered at the end of the meal. Another drawback was the total absence of reading materials in English or in French except a few China Daily newspapers. A large proportion of the offered movies were oldies. If you are not interested in food if you bring your own reading materials Air China is a good option as it is cheap and not too many people fly it so you have plenty of space.,5/29/2012,4,4,1,2,4,4
A Dixon,0,AMS-ERCAN-AMS. Flights to ECN do not fly direct but via Antalya (ATY) due to international flying regulations to N. Cyprus. Old B738. Cabin full of young holiday makers chaotic boarding and dismemberment. No clear instructions to passengers on landing at ATY. Half-hour after landing crew announces passengers to disembark and change to a sister plane. On return at around 1am captain announces problems with wheel during landing at ATY. Passengers ferried to transit lounge waiting for plane to be repaired. Resume journey 90 min later. No announcements made in English except some Dutch and local language not even at ATY airport. FA totally unprofessional and rude especially on the return flight. Aircraft's old cramped soiled seating cabin lights blinking badly maintained aircraft's. No IFE. Food expensive and of low quality. Not recommended will never fly Corendon.,9/4/2013,3,1,3,0,1,2

Price was much lower than competition.,10/18/2013,4,1,5,4,3,8
Alan McGaughey,1,Flew with Aer Lingus round trip Dublin-Gatwick this week. Very pleased with the service overall. The outbound flight on Tuesday was lightly booked and we got away early. Terminal 2 is very pleasant to use and even the security area was moving quickly. This was the first time I had used the pre-order meal service and it worked well in getting the breakfast before the main cabin service began. It is good value and I would estimate that about 10 of the 50 or so passengers had pre-ordered. Coming back was even easier at Gatwick airport and this was an almost full flight. The cabin crew were especially good. I ordered tea and the cheese board (could do with a little more cheese). Weather was bad coming into Dublin in the aftermath of the storms and I could tell we weren't going to be able to land from the approach and just before touchdown we went on a go around. The Captain came on and was very re-assuring and explained what had happened and again the cabin crew were very reassuring in making the extra safety announcements. Nice experience and nice product and great crew.,2/14/2014,4,4,5,0,4,9
A Kuschel,1,Flight SXF-SVO-SXF. Very new A320 aircraft with lots of leg room. FA's speak good English are friendly and generally very attentive.

A Veccio,1,Flew BA on open-jaw route BRU-LHR-LAX returning one week later SFO-LHR-BRU. BRU-LHR was on an A319 newly refurbished plane. I paid for seating selection weeks before. The day before on-line check-in opened I saw that some seats on the front of the plane became available to economy travellers with no surcharge so I took one of them to deplane as quick as possible (the plane landed a little bit ahead of schedule anyway). LHR-LAX on the A380 was a really nice experience really smooth flight and incredibly quiet upper-deck cabin. Food was not bad as long as you don't expect anything too fancy in economy. There was only one complete meal after take off and a pre- arrival snack before landing. On an 11 hours flight this may seem not enough but passengers are welcome to pick up snacks in the galley during the flight as well as having drinks fixed on demand. Only one negative spot of the flight: the cabin was really cold! SFO-LHR still on the A380 departed a little bit late due to a malfunction of one of the doors but crew kept us informed of the situation. Same nice experience nice crew and so on. LHR-BRU on an A320 departed late after being stuck on tarmac due to high departure rate at Heathrow. Once again the captain kept us informed and managed to catch most of the delay before landing in Brussels. Overall really nice experience but I wish they would not charge as much for seating selection before online check in. As I may be a nervous flyer I need a window seat and don't want to risk seating elsewhere. The four legs cost me more than 130 euros on pre-paid seating which I could take into account when choosing between BA and an another airline that let you choose free of charge when booking your flight. Besides that I won't hesitate to fly BA in the future.,5/12/2015,4,4,4,4,5,9
A Dobbs,0,Comfortable - no space - none competency - lacking. My parents and I travelled from Dublin to Abu Dhabi and then to Sydney on Oct 25th and return on Nov 15th. I am just 5ft 3 and I found seat space minimal. Food was disgusting on both journeys. We found the staff rude and unhelpful. They ran out of food and by time they got to us there was no choice left. One of the air hostess actually said to me 'I have nothing left for you. I guess I can check 1st class but don't hold your breath'. I was polite to all staff but was ignored on more than one occasion. As for Abu Dhabi the airport is easy to get around but again the staff are lacking in basic customer service.

A Vitali,0,CDG-DXB-KIX NRT-DXB-CDG. A380 / B777-300ER. First time with Emirates with high expectations. In terms of aircraft's themselves not disappointed at all. Great seats (especially on the A380) with space enough to bear long flights and extremely wide selection of entertainment. What disappointed me was first of all the service. In all 4 legs almost all crew members were almost bothered to give service. No smiles at all. When you asked them something basic like a glass of water you almost felt you were bothering them. Another disappointment was food quality and quantity. Continental breakfast from DXB left me hungry for few hours. The rest of meals acceptable but not good as other European Airlines (AF or KLM for example). Overall really not in line with my expectations and not same overall level as other airlines as SQ or QF. Anyway prices keep being competitive so at the end fair value for money.,5/20/2015,3,5,2,5,1,6
A Kutlu,0,"A330-300 MEL-HKG QF29 HKG-MEL QF30. It was a quite old plane with very old seats and useless flight entertainment system. No hot towels neither refreshment wipes before the flight. Polite looking but unfortunately unhelpful cabin crew. I had a special request food but could not eat it because of the heavy spice taste and smell. I went to the kitchen and asked for something else to eat according to my special dietary requirements but got the answer ""there is nothing for you to eat on this plane"" rather then getting offered simply for a piece of fruit or a packet of crackers. The person in front of me asked for a spare bottle of water but was declined. Finally I have got the impression from the cabin crew that I have to enjoy with what I have got because they were too busy and unwilling to offer any more than that. This was my first flight experience with Qantas and because of couple of small problems it will probably be the last one.",1/26/2015,1,2,1,1,2,3
Alan Mitchell,0,LGW-TLL return. Flexible economy ticket - Â£300 allows passengers to sit in the business class cabin which was worth it as no complimentary catering in the Y cabin. Food okay - served on china tableware. Metal cutlery. Poor selection of drinks though with white wine very lukewarm. Overall a decent product at a very decent price for a 2.5-3 hour flight. Estonian are the only airline to fly direct LGW-TLL and for that alone I'd recommend them.,6/25/2006,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Doig,0,Flew to Alicante last week. Paid the fee for our measly 15kg bag allowance. Checked in online arrived at Edinburgh to depart to find a massive slow moving queue. My 2 year old was getting tired and cranky. Then was told because my bag was 15.5kg and my wife's was 16kg we would be charged Â£100 for being over weight if we couldn't re-pack. The ignorant woman at check in couldn't care less about our upset child. We managed to get our luggage re-packed and I was told by another member of staff that my bag would be fine at 15.5kg. When getting onto the plane to get or free for all seat rush. My wife asks for assistance to find at least two seats together but the stewardess snootily told her to keep moving up the plane and find a seat. Luckily somebody moved so that she could sit with our child. Then you have to spend the rest of the flight listening to bored and rude cabin crew trying to sell things. Not the greatest start to our 1st family holiday. Have flown with Ryanair before to stags with friends with only hand luggage but will never use them again for a family holiday. They just don't care about their customers or the quality of your journey.,9/6/2012,2,2,1,NaN,1,1
Alan O'Connor,1,DUB-ZRH-FLR 29/10/13. Two excellent flights on well maintained planes. Excellent service. Both planes on time. Cabin crew excellent. Nice pizza snack and chocolate free of charge. Info on Zurich-Florence flight (gate no. etc) available on Dublin leg into Zurich. Flying as it used to be. Will definitely use again for European travel and maybe further afield! Excellent value for money (Star Alliance booking Lufthansa on the way home).,11/5/2013,5,5,4,0,5,10
A Kyprianou,1,I fly Jet return about once a month Heathrow - Delhi - Dhaka mostly. Food is always the same (hasn't changed in 3 years) films only change every 3 months (maybe) and they are the same selection outbound and inbound. Service is average. There is zero recognition of Gold or Platinum international members loyalty (except for use of very poor below standard lounge at Delhi).,12/6/2013,3,4,2,2,3,5
A Vlasov,1,LGW-RIX-LGW. Outbound leg was 2 hrs delayed the reason was not explained. Cabin attendants were obviously tired and unfriendly they ignored me when I wanted to buy a snack!,6/17/2012,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,4
A Domican,1,Flew business class to Dubai. Clubhouse fantastic flight very good staff very attentive a bit mean with drink offerings but I put it down to being an overnight flight. Amenity kit is rubbish compared to Ethiad or Qatar bed very comfortable and I slept for 3 hrs. Looking forward to return flight to compare it with outbound. Would recommend. Inflight entertainment terrible as it was an old plane they give out iPads with films on them.,8/18/2013,3,5,3,1,5,5
Alan Petten,1,SIN-CPH April 2014 777 was in good condition. Nice layout in business class. Beds were good I am tall and just fit the bed system which isn't always the case. Service was good and food was decent. Nice lounge in SIN.,4/27/2015,4,5,5,5,5,9
A Lack,0,W6 3302 London Luton - Cluj-Napoca 11 Sep 2014. W6 3301 Cluj-Napoca - London Luton 15 Sep 2014. Dreadful airline. I've travelled through extremely poor areas of the world and have never experienced such shocking service filthy damaged planes and rude members of staff. It makes Ryanair seem like a dream! Fly easyjet or any other low cost carrier.,9/19/2014,1,1,1,1,1,1

A Douas,0,ATH-LHR A321. Some things never change. Food inedible I knew this so I went onboard with a full stomach. I understand priority luggage should come first but not 10 minutes before everyone else's! I have noticed this on a couple of Aegean flights. Plane was new and clean as always cabin crew decent. Aegean if you want those extra stars you need better food better luggage handling services and more happy faces!,5/8/2012,4,5,1,2,3,8
A Lamb,1,"London-Reyjavik-Boston-Reyjavik-London. Economy class they were excellent throughout plenty of leg room and I'm 6'1"". Staff were pleasant and all flights left on time no delays. No complimentary food on USA flights but I knew that before I booked. Was disappointed with the selection of food available to purchase. Would definitely fly with them again.",10/31/2014,5,4,2,4,4,9
A Walker,0,LHR-SYD Economy class with my husband and 22 month old son. Checked in 2 hrs prior to departure after 30 minutes in line we found we had been assigned seats in different rows. We boarded only to sit on the tarmac for an hour. After take off my son became ill I pressed the buzzer for help and the stewardess arranged to get him to the medical centre in the airport after disembarking. When getting back on the flight we saw 3 side seats free however just before we took off another couple swapped their seats and took them. My husband had no inflight entertainment and it was unable to be fixed. As the plane began to descend into Sydney we were moved to Business class (which was 75% empty) so that quarantine could talk to us before we got off the plane. I can safely say that after my nearly 15 years in the travel industry I have never experienced such bad service.,2/8/2012,3,3,2,2,1,3
A Douas,1,TIP-ATH. A very comfortable flight on leather seats on new CRJ-900. Breakfast well served with a generous portion. Service went smoothly and efficiently crew were English speaking. Plane interior clean. Flight left on time and seemingly no worries about cent for cent baggage weight checking. All in all a very pleasant experience.,2/23/2012,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
Alan Pratt,1,VS021 VS022 LHR-IAD-LHR. A330-300. Good flights on newish aircraft. FAs were attentive and friendly. Food was better than usual but hot breakfast on return flight did not meet expectations. Check in at LHR and IAD both swift and efficient. Seating good until recline used in front of us then very difficult to leave seat. Should recline seats be banned? FE had a good selection of new and older movies.,4/27/2015,4,4,4,4,4,8
A Lane,1,Flew out of Gatwick to Toronto 14/02/14 and back to London the following week on a new A330/200. All I can say is what a surprise! The aircraft was new the entertainment system good the staff extremely helpful and attentive. Food was ok. General service is easily on par with BA Virgin or ACA in economy - and generally a lot better in many cases. They have definitely raised their game and I see them as a credible alternative to many '4/5 star airlines' if you have to fly economy.,2/24/2014,5,3,3,4,4,9
A Walsh,1,"Excellent friendly service. Able to fly in and out of Cardiff when other flights were cancelled due to fog. Maybe more expensive than alternatives, but reliable. Preferred airline on the Cardiff-Dublin route.",6/19/2015,4,3,3,NaN,5,10
A Dow,0,Taipei to Vancouver in Business Class. No alcoholic welcome drinks offered upon boarding only water and juice. They were quick to announce that since this was a late evening departure they would be serving only a light meal - but since it was only 11pm I felt this a bit of a cheap excuse since the flight is nearly 12 hours in duration. Even after take-off I had to ask for a drink as it became evident they weren't going to offer any before the light meal - of which there only two choices (one Asian and one sort-of Western) - wine was ok. As far as I could tell there was no service between meals - not even water trips - though they did hand out small bottles early on. Contrary to other suggestions here and elsewhere this route does not have angled beds in J/C Class - only the old z-style recliner seat. AVOD was pretty good - with a decent selection of both movies and music - didn't go back to Y section so not sure what was available there. Biz class seat was a bit cheaper than others flying the route - but to be honest I would have been much better of flying Cathay in Y class and saving the difference.,8/21/2010,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,5
A Langenhoven,1,Cape Town to PE my first time flying with my 11 month old baby. I requested a porter to help push the trolley. At check-in I was not asked if I needed a porter I did not know that I had to ask. When I boarded the plane they gave me a window seat next to 2 other passengers. Fortunately the flight attendant offered me a seat for myself and my baby alone.,9/1/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
Alan Ramsay,0,Lisbon to Heathrow in Sep 2012 with onward flight to Glasgow. First I was bumped off my booked flight with inadequate explanation. Made to wait for an hour despite turning up on time to have cancellation of seat confirmed and booked on a later flight. Was reassured I would make my re-arranged connection. However TAP announced a delay to the second flight Lisbon departure making it very tight to make the next BA connection. Pointed this out to them but treated in a very off-hand fashion and told there would be no problem. This second flight was further delayed taking off and after landing at Heathrow took 30 to 40 mins bringing up the steps. I told flight staff but complete disinterest. They also lost my luggage for both this and the outward flight to Lisbon for 3 days. Missed connection to Glasgow and therefore the last evening flight to Glasgow. Went immediately searching for TAP staff but they had all left. Had to book a hotel at my own expense overnight and sort out rebooking BA flight in the morning to Glasgow. TAP customer care is absolutely dreadful.,12/5/2012,1,3,3,0,1,NaN
A Walter,1,Sydney to Vancouver via Shanghai. I travel extensively and the service punctuality food and checking in was up there with the best! On 2 of the 4 legs there was no entertainment but with tablets and ipads what does that really matter especially when you are saving a considerable amount on the airfare. The food was first rate and the service great every flight was on time.,3/18/2013,5,4,5,3,5,9
A Drennan,1,BNE-MEL MEL-OOL. Travelled to Melbourne with two small grandchildren and staff could not have been friendlier or more helpful. Flights were on time and value for money was excellent. I will definitely be travelling them again!,7/8/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,10
A Lathan,0,Las Vegas to Stansted. I loved the seats food and service onboard Maxjet. Service was wonderful except that they ran out of chicken dinners before we were served and had to choose the Veal. In row 3 I thought we would have been first up but ended up being served last. We chose central aisle seats and loved the freedom they provided. Huge thanks to flight attendants for great service. Stansted to LV went smoothly and our flight even arrived early. Digeplayers worked great food was fine service fine and loved the lounge at Stansted. We shared it with the New York flight and it didn't seem to be overcrowded. Free newspapers snack buffet drinks internet stations were all appreciated. Both my husband and I are in our mid 40's enjoyed our journey with MaxJet. A couple of things I would consider when we book with them again is to not book connecting flights within 24 hours of our arrival in London. We lost our connecting flights (non-refundable) and I'm waiting to see how that works out with MaxJet. The customer service rep promised refunds but I haven't heard back yet. We did purchase trip insurance but we'll see how that works out as well. We had to rebook our connecting flight at more than double the original cost to us. I also wish that Las Vegas had a lounge. If the California flights have a lounge we would probably opt to book via California. Express security is wonderful! I think MaxJet is worth flying a good product at a great price. Just be sure that you can be a bit flexible if the plane is delayed.,7/30/2007,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,4
Alan Sargeant,1,Odessa to Moscow and Moscow to Mineralnye Vody (code share with Don Avia). The flights were like chalk and cheese. The early flight from Odessa was on time efficient check in and an adequate breakfast. Seats OK and no in flight entertainment. Cabin crew polite and efficient. Second flight was originally delayed by 90 minutes and then by another 5 hours and another 2 hours after that. Meal voucher was given (inadequate for a reasonable meal given airport prices) but no real apology and explanations in English lacking. Soon after takeoff I moved seats and slept so no comments possible about staff - they seemed not to speak much English. My rating of the flights reflects very much the impact of the delay on the Moscow - Mineralnye Vody sector.,9/3/2012,4,4,4,1,4,2
A Dron,1,London Luton - Bacau return. Long queues at Luton check-in which barely moved for 15 minutes until further desks were opened. Thereafter smooth. Boeing 737-400 virtually full in both directions. Dark blue leather seats slightly showing their age but interior otherwise fine including toilets. Drinks (including decent Romanian wine) available to purchase and staff seemed friendly. On return route there seemed to be wider selection of sandwiches and snacks on offer. Return flight delayed by 30 minutes with no explanation given (at least not in English). In general seemed perfectly adequate low-cost carrier (although my travelling companion who had bought the tickets at relatively short notice told me that they were not cheap).,4/1/2013,3,3,3,0,3,6
A Wang,0,CX565 from Osaka to Hong Kong 20th Sep 13. This flight stop over is in Taipei. Staff on this flight not very courteous and not very helpful. When we reached Taipei the crew just hid they acted as if they had nothing to do with the passenger cleaners hopped on anto d clean up. A female crew came over to ask whether my child wanted a children's meal. I said there was no need to prepare a children's meal. I also have a baby I asked if my baby could have the children's meal. After a while a staff member came over to tell me that because the baby travels for free they are not supposed to have a meal. I just didn't realise the service from Business to Economy could can be so different.,10/29/2013,1,1,1,1,1,1
A Du Preez,1,I am currently in Entebbe (Uganda) and awaiting to board the delayed flight SA161 to JNB. It was scheduled to take off at 07.25 in Uganda but we have been informed that it will only take off by 10am today (25 May 2013). My concern is that I have a connection flight to PE scheduled to take off from JNB by 13.10pm (SA417). My incoming flight will then literally arrive minutes before SA417 will depart for PE. I am therefore looking forward in anticipation to see how SAA will deal with and co-ordinate linking myself up with the flight to PE later today. If SAA can pull this one off without a passenger having to be inconvenienced it will be great. Time will tell as it is currently impossible to inquire about this at the Entebbe Airport and having cleared customs already.,5/26/2013,4,4,4,4,4,7
Alan Sargeant,1,Bangkok to Almaty. Excellent flight friendly and helpful flight attendants. Cabin crews English is getting better and more than adequate for a foreigner travelling with them. Food was good but could have been a little better. Seats good - not quite a bed but allow you to stretch and sleep. Portable hand held entertainment units not so good compared with other airlines. I upgraded at airport and this represents excellent value. Pre-booked business class is not good value.,5/7/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9

Alan Sargeant,1,Omsk-Moscow-St Petersburg. Small problems with check-in at Omsk and only received one boarding pass. Breakfast was good and the service leisurely for a 3 hrs plus flight. Plane was full and the flight left and landed on time. Was surprised that they had an English language paper on board. This is an improvement on previous internal flights. Moscow-St Petersburg is a short 80 min flight and received a quick and light second breakfast which was just adequate for this flight. Again the flight left and landed on time.,7/27/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Dunn,0,I was rebooked on US Airways after a United flight was delayed. Then the US Airways flight was delayed and we had to disembark. I had to rebook my trip because my onward US flight to Tel Aviv would have left. The customer service agent said I did not pay for the ticket and wondered several times why I was allowed to board. She called her supervisor who discovered I had paid (business class) and that is why I was on their flight. I received no apology but lots of attitude. So no more US Airways.,11/17/2014,1,3,0,0,1,NaN
Alan Sargeant,0,Ekaterinburg to St Petersburg. Flight left and landed slightly ahead of time. Emergency room seat so had plenty of legroom. Seat did not recline. Breakfast basic but adequate and there was a choice. Flight announcements in English and Russian but cabin staff did not speak English not were they listening to foreigners speaking Russian. Aircraft adequate and there were no problems with the actual flight.,5/18/2012,4,4,3,0,3,6
A LeClair,1,"I recently took a trip from Albany to Orlando and thoroughly enjoyed it. Although the boarding process is a little strange as long as you check in on time there is a very good chance that you will find good seats even if you are traveling with family members. I got B27 because I checked in a little late but I was still able to get a window seat over the wing like I wanted. And since I only brought a suitcase and a small duffel bag I didn't have to check any luggage which is free for two bags anyway. I am 5' 3"" and small but I imagine that someone much taller and larger would still be as comfortable as I was in the seats. The planes were very clean and the staff were very welcoming and enthusiastic especially on the way down to Orlando. The flight attendants are quite funny during the safety briefing and manage to make you feel as if you are listening to a human being instead of a monotonous robot. They were also sympathetic when our flight back to Albany from Baltimore was delayed about an hour and our gate was switched twice and the captain addressed us personally to apologize. As all three of my flights were less than 3 hours each I didn't order anything but the complimentary snacks were a nice touch. Although each plane I flew on was wifi-equipped I did not purchase it but I did use the free flight tracker. Overall Southwest offered outstanding service and comfort at a lower price than most other airlines that I have flown on. Southwest has given me an experience that I would gladly repeat many times.",1/21/2015,5,5,5,NaN,5,10
A Dwyer,1,I flew from Shannon to Boston yesterday 7 July and must say that I was both shocked and horrified that three of the female cabin crew including the cabin manager were chewing gum whilst serving food etc. I expect that here by the staff on US carriers but not Aer Lingus. Otherwise the flight was faultless.,7/8/2012,4,4,3,5,4,8
Alan Sargeant,1,Bangkok to Melbourne. Attentive flight attendants with good service all the way. Food plentiful and tasty. Food was well presented and hot. Cabin attendants were cheerful and very pleasant. Seats were comfortable and enabled good rest especially between Brunei and Melbourne. Flights departed and arrived on time. Now my first choice for flights from Australia to Asia and beyond.,6/4/2012,5,4,5,4,5,9
A Earl,0,LHR-ADD and ADD-LXR and LXR-LHR. Throughout the whole process from check-in (on all 6 flights) to cabin crew apart from a few exceptions the attitude of the staff was almost rude and uncaring. The security checks were inconsistent - sometimes water allowed on the flight sometimes not (even if bought in the airport) or once only if I paid the official! Food was just about acceptable but no alcohol. Film choices limited and many quite old. I would definitely not choose to use them again.,4/16/2013,3,3,2,2,1,3
A Lee,0,CCS-HAV-CCS. Received 2 emails a week before the flights that both departure times changed and had to change connection flight on the return. Arrived 4 hrs early to make sure the time wasn't going to change again but the flight was not listed on the departure board. 30 mins before we were supposed to take off there was a line to an unmarked check-in counter next to where we were told to wait finally check-in and told to go to gate 21B which doesn't exist but we all wait in the area of gate 21. 3 hrs later we are escorted to a bus that drives 10 mins away from the airport to an abandoned air strip. Ended up getting to Cuba around midnight and again they drive the bus away from the main terminal to another out of the way receiving area. Lost a day and gained unwanted stress on the way there.,10/5/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
Alan Sayers,0,Last December booked Gatwick-Dalaman return for September. Message was left on my mobile 3 days before outbound flight to say that the outbound flight was cancelled also received an email. No replies to my emails so had to call the shambolic call centre in Turkey (cost Â£5.20) and was told there was an alternative Stanstad-Istanbul-Dalaman a day later than original outbound date or Â£126 refund within 48 hours. Booked alternative with Onur no problems whatsoever. That was over 4 weeks ago have sent over 50 emails to various email addresses within Pegasus and to date have had no replies whatsoever.,10/8/2010,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Watson,0,My husband and I flew to Dalaman and on to Ercan Nicosia return. We were onboard for over 6 hrs with only one small meal and an even smaller drink provided. While we can understand a mean meal what we cannot understand is the meanness of the beverage provided. There were no offers of any kind of drink even at a charge. Cabin staff appeared to be more concerned with their own comfort and gossip rather then attending to the passengers' needs.,10/3/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Eckardt,1,FRA-SIN on A380. The upper deck is a real comfy little cabin as there are only around 15 rows in Economy. This improves the service even more. Food reasonable as always. IFE broke down after 6 hours and couldn't be fixed again bud didn't want to switch my seat. I like the opportunity to charge my mobile at the plane as I use it a lot for listening to music.,9/29/2013,3,5,4,2,4,7
A Leibiebowitz,1,PVG-NRT-JFK Shanghai-Tokyo-New York 6/5/2014: Both flights on 773 one older livery and one new both 3 class. I was originally booked for business class my husband was supposed to be as well however after a screw up by our travel agent he found himself in economy. Although I did not cause a disturbance at the counter I guess my face showed my disappointment at the incompetence of our travel agent. To my surprise the woman checking us in bumped me to first for the first leg of our flight because they couldn't help my husband at that point. Upon our arrival at NRT before disembarking there was an announcement for my husband to see a cabin attendant. They found a seat for him in premium economy NRT-JFK with no extra charge. My husband reported that economy service and entertainment options were very good and the seats were comfortable. I briefly checked out the lounges as I did not want to abandon my husband for too long. Lounges had a good selection of food table service bar changing room etc. In-flight the attendants are what you expect from Japanese service including bowing in multiples. I had a chance to enjoy a full Japanese meal and a Western meal both near excellent the Japanese meal edged ahead for presentation. The entertainment system was not the best I have experienced but it was very good and there are plenty of English and Japanese movies and programing to choose from. The staggered seats are comfortable I have no real problem with the foot cubby. I was pleased to find each seat had an additional cushion which unfolded for making the lie-flat seats even and more comfortable for sleeping. I used it the whole flight even when sitting up. I recommend choosing a seat with the side-table on the aisle they are more private. The check-in and in-flight crew on ANA is one of the most attentive and gracious I have ever come across. In my experience ANA's rating is well deserved.,6/25/2014,5,4,5,4,5,10
Alan Slomowitz,0,Nothing wrong with the service or the food but on some routes such as Barcelona to New York the planes are old and do not have individual entertainment systems. This means you have to watch whatever film is being shown on the overhead monitors making for a very long trip. There is a huge amount of competition out there so unless AA/US Air get new planes I will not be flying with them again.,4/21/2014,4,3,3,1,4,2
A Weera,0,I have been travelling on SIA for last 12 years. I find the standard of service dropping every time I take the airline in the recent past. NZ to Singapore is a long trip. The service was really poor never got what was requested. Food was bad did not even bother to eat my final meal on the return trip to NZ. Some staff rude their standard of service was bias on the type of passenger. July trip was the worst airline experience I have had in my 20 years of airline travel. Very substandard service. In future travelling on SIA is not a status but a necessity.,10/1/2013,2,4,1,4,1,5
A Edwards,0,Ryanair are a rip off we booked a 2 week holiday with Ryanair able to print off our boarding passes for the flight out but not for the flight back. I assumed you were just given them at the airport on the way back when we arrived at the airport we went to the check in desk and were directed to another desk where they told us that we would have to pay Â£350 or we would not be allowed on the flight as a family with 4 young children we had no choice but to hand over the money. This is a terrible way to run an airline taking all that money from a family and being told we would have to pay or we would not be getting on the flight.,4/23/2014,1,1,1,NaN,1,1
Alan Steinberg,1,I have just returned from the Ukraine via Amsterdam. I can say that from A to Z KLM was excellent. It was easy to Web check in. Boarding was efficient and orderly. The flight crew were helpful and greeted us with warm and friendly smiles. I can only offer praise for KLM as all flights were on time and baggage delivered quickly. Whenever possible I will fly KLM - Schiphol was also a very user friendly airport.,10/5/2014,4,4,5,4,5,10
A Weishaupt,0,Flight from Cairo to Beijing. Old Business Class the seats were not comfortable at all. The legroom was like in Economy. The First Class cabin also seemed to offer less comfort than Business normally does. Food was ok. The only advantage is the good value for money.,7/24/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,2

A Eliz,1,Flew round trip out of Fort Wayne to Phoenix. This was the only airline close by that was affordable for entire family to fly. The flight left early both times boarding started 45 minutes before departure time and we were on the runway 5 minutes prior to departure time and arrived earlier. I did pay for 5 seats and a checked bag and still came out ahead. The kids used backpacks and my husband and I each had a small bag that we put under our seats. They may have eyed our bags but never measured or asked any questions. The check in desk attendants and flight crew were all very nice. This trip definitely can compare to flying Delta. The plane was MD-80 very clean and comfortable. I will fly them again. I highly recommend being at the gate and checked in ready to go at least one hour prior to departure they board early and quickly!,4/27/2014,5,5,5,0,5,10
Alan Tang,1,Taken return flights from CGK-SYD flying economy class with load factor was only about 30-50% on each flight. The check-in process in CGK was very slow and the staff wasn't really enthusiast although I'm a gold frequent flyer card holder. Both flights were so far so great cabin crew were very friendly and attentive especially on the SYD- CGK sector. The meal were also very tasty even though the quantity was very small. The entertainment system was a little bit disappointing and not updated compared to other airlines. Overall very nice trip to fly with Garuda Indonesia as the service has continued to improve and the cabin crew do represent the company's missions.,5/19/2013,5,4,5,3,5,8
A Wellington,1,Flew Asiana for the first time in early February from Seoul to San Francisco. Check in organized and professional. Lounge in Incheon nicely presented with lots of seats (many of which were 'reserved') and escort service to gates provided. Once onboard attendant provided me with pre-flight drinks and snacks. Sat on individual window seat and seats were fantastic and fully adjustable to 180 beds. Meal service was the highlight for me and presented nicely on fine china. Service was excellent and will definitely fly more often.,2/26/2013,5,5,5,5,5,10
A Levy,1,This was the first time flying with LOT in many years and I have to say they have upped the ante. Flew PRG-WAW- ORD. First segment was on a comfortable E175 with excellent service. Second segment was the game-changer. 787 Dreamliner in Business Class. The cabin was maybe half full - the service was absolutely stellar. They provided sheets for the fully lay flat seat after the best meal which was delicious. I had requested a vegetarian meal which come out perfectly but also wanted to try the Vegetable Moussaka which was served for dinner so they let me have one of those as well. They served a nice selection of champagne and wine came around the cabin offering their special Black Currant Vodka which we tried and which was delicious. We finished our dinner with two glasses of Polish mead. The attention to detail in the cabin was what impressed me. They would only cross over in the galley even though the first row of seats in the middle were empty. Upon deplaning they all had their positions in the cabin from which they said goodbye. My favorite J seat across the Atlantic is usually on the 747-800i with Lufthansa and I have to admit - this was completely on par with that. Frankfurt has more connections to the rest of Europe but if the times and connections are right I would very happily and very well will most likely fly with LOT in the future. This was a ticket just so I could try out the 787 which I hadn't flown yet but I was so impressed with LOT's service it's going on my list of preferred airlines. Well done to the J cabin crew and purser LO 3 on April 6 WAW-ORD.,4/8/2015,4,4,4,4,5,10
A Elliott,0,DUB-ARN return both ways on Boeing 737-600. Check in was nothing special ground staff were pleasant. I find the check in system in ARN slightly confusing but ground staff were lovely and helped out. On board however it was an entirely different story. Stony faced cold unwelcoming cabin crew all but one of which didn't at all smile. Seats were hard and uncomfortable. I had less legroom than on a Ryanair flight which for a full service airline and more importantly a full service price. Also there was no food offered only cups of water. Everything else was a buy on board service which for a full service airline is just disgraceful. Positives however were a clean plane and on time departure and arrival.,6/23/2013,2,2,1,1,3,5
Alan Tang,0,KL3401/AZ0107 (AMS-FCO): I bought the ticket via KLM website as they are both members of Skyteam. The aircraft was an A320 which looks ageing on the seats and cabin layout. Service was very basic with the selection of salty snack or sweet snack and the choices of drinks were very little (arancia rossa/orange juice hot tea hot coffee or water/sparkling water). Crew were not very welcoming and seemed not to enjoy their job I also did notice that the crew did not pay attention carefully to passengers who have not opened the windows shades and fastened the seat belt before landing. In a sum Alitalia is not up to standard of premium airlines that they claim to be. Many rooms for improvements in order to compete with other regional airlines. On the bright side the landing was very smooth and we arrived earlier as expected arrival time.,11/25/2014,3,3,2,2,2,6
A West,1,Gatwick to Moscow. Family of four. I was quite wary of booking with EasyJet for a mid length flight but the experience was absolutely fine. Check in and boarding was simple. Staff both ends were friendly and efficient. There were a lot of Russians on the flights but EasyJet have employed some English speaking Russian flight attendants to handle them. Yes the food wasn't cheap but in quality and price it compared favourably with UK rail and motorway services offerings. Even with the food added to the ticket price costs were less than half of a comparable flight with other airlines. Maybe on a longer flight I would yearn for an in flight movie and some free drink but if I go back to Moscow I will use EasyJet.,10/20/2013,5,5,4,NaN,5,8
A Li,1,Internal flights in Colombia (BOG-SMR CTG-BOG) were real value for money. The planes were clean the service was good and the free Juan Valdez snack (peanuts and some little cookie) were delicious. Excellent value for short flights.,6/25/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,10
Alan Thompson,1,London City to Bari via Rome Bari to Heathrow via Linate. Slow bag drop at City but quickly through security. Flight to Rome fine. Rome Fumicino still a shambles after the fire lucky we had a long wait for the slightly late Bari flight as transiting was a nightmare. Home trip on time both legs and very fast. Nice crews drinks and snacks adequate. Fare was half that of BA and Easyjet at the UK half term break.,6/4/2015,5,5,4,0,4,8
A Lightbody,0,DTW to RSW 12/24 #605. RSW to DTW 678. We will never fly Spirit again. Cramped seats going to Florida and so far 1.5 hr delay in clear weather. All other carriers can get me to my destination on time but I have to buy a new ticket. Spirit has no relationships since they are a local low class carrier.,1/3/2014,1,1,1,1,3,NaN
A Whittle,1,"Round trip SAN/PVR April 4-12. Alaska's first is more of a ""light first"". Seats and legroom just so so. Same pasta dish on both legs served along side a small salad. No roll butter or dessert. Flight attendants on both legs were great they seemed embarrassed about the meal quality but kept drinks flowing and were very pleasant. Both flights on time. Travelled on BA award tickets.",4/23/2013,4,3,2,0,5,5
A Elskary,0,Cabin crew stood chatting and ignored passengers as they boarded. After snack was served the cabin crew disappeared. Crew never smiled or talked nicely to passengers once throughout the flight. Crew looked unkempt and not smartly dressed. Very unprofessional crew on the 4 flights I used. Terrible service. Announcements were inaudible and cut off mid sentence and pilot announcements could not be understood at all.,12/18/2014,2,3,1,1,1,4
Alan Thompson,1,"Booked a hand luggage only fare at short notice so it was pricey. Allocated a decent seat but amazed at charge of â‚¬26 to change it so didn't bother. Flight seemed to be full of families split up probably for the same reason. A ripoff. Flight was late, usual excuse of late arrival from a previous flight. Flight deck crew affable. Food and drink good and free, a bonus. Cabin attendants, an older purser up front a bit patronising. The two in economy were really going through the motions, no eye contact and perfunctory service. 1 drink served in a 2.5 hour flight. For the last hour the two at the back were eating Club Europe meals which I saw them bring from the front. This was BA2591 on 22 July. Not great.",7/23/2015,3,4,4,NaN,1,7
A Lim,1,Flew SIN-BKK and BKK-SIN. Both trips were smooth. Will fly with Tiger again for my regional trips. Cheapest and value for money.,11/22/2013,5,3,4,0,4,7
A England,0,IST-HKG. I am afraid Turkish Airlines is slipping. The check in and immigration lines at the Istanbul airport are lengthy and bureaucratic. I was pleased with the overnight travel kit. The food was average but the drinks were plentiful. There were films TV series and music selections but the choices were limited and dated. The touch screens cannot be fully navigated from the remote so the passenger behind me was pecking at my seat repeatedly. The plane was dated and rather warm. No one was using their blankets. Finally the service was rushed and English and Chinese were limited. The English announcements were comical.,12/12/2013,2,2,3,2,1,5
A Wilhelm,0,Today is 6/28/15. My flight was to leave at 1:30pm. At 12:50 I got a courtesy notification that my flight is delayed and would now leave at 6pm. It also said flight time is not certain.  Now I can't reach their call center. And it may take more than 1 hour to get an agent to pick your call. So I booked my entire round trip from another reliable brand to fly out today. It sure is a very costly lesson to learn. ,6/28/2015,1,1,NaN,NaN,1,1
Alan Thompson,1,London Heathrow to Iceland Keflavik return. A very good experience though pricey probably due to UK half term holiday. Simple online check-in and bag drop for each sector very roomy in Economy in-flight entertainment fine. Good service on board free hot and soft drinks. Both flights arrived slightly early. Baggage retrieval fast in Iceland slow at Heathrow. Very civilized.,2/26/2013,3,5,4,4,5,9
A Williams,1,6-10th Jan. PER-SIN-PER. Service in the cabin was non-existent I couldn't get anyone to come to my seat with my service light on for hours I gave up. Both flights there and back were cold particularly the outbound flight. The aircon was broken it was freezing and we weren't offered different seats even though there were many available that were much warmer. Eventually given a free blanket hours later. The sorting out of pre-booked meals is stupid. It takes hours to get all the pre-booked meals delivered and meanwhile there is no service from the cabin crew you cant get a drink or anything until about 2-3 hours into the flight. For these reasons I would only choose to fly Scoot again if the fare is very cheap.,1/15/2014,5,4,1,1,1,5
A Euba,0,Leg room on A340 gives a generous pitch and baggage allowance is a generous 30 kilos. Inflight entertainment was very poor. They didn't provide headphones I was told the IFE did not work in some seats. Eventually I was given headphones and told to try my luck quality was very poor. The food was very bland- and the portions small. I was within the first 20 and told the beef had run out. Crew were polite enough but I didn't get the impression of being greatly experienced. Fly Arik if you want a comfortable seat and have a lot of luggage if inflight entertainment food and service is important to you stay well clear.,3/7/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,5
A Lindau,1,KUL-STN: Comfortable seats delicious food (as always with Air Asia) and a bigger legroom than many other carriers! At this price Air Asia X is a great deal indeed. Just bring enough books/magazines/etc as there is no entertainment on board.,2/5/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
Alan Vee,0,We were standing in line at the airport waiting to check in 2 hours before the flight due to a disabled child travelling and I received a text telling me our flight was cancelled due to weather. All other airlines were on time except Tiger who thought it reasonable to notify me with an SMS informing me I am also not entitled to a refund due to weather! Need I say more?,9/17/2014,1,0,0,0,1,NaN
A Williams,0,I certainly wouldn't fly with this airline again. I had possibly the worst flight experience in all my years of travelling. Non existent fight attendants resulting in a large party of young travellers helping themselves to vast quantities of booze. As a result I ended up without a seat and the crew kept fobbing me off saying they were trying to sort it. I was left standing for 2.5 hours. Absolutely unacceptable. Never will they get my business again.,4/21/2014,1,2,1,3,1,NaN
A Linsley,1,I flew from Stansted to Antalya via Istanbul it was my first time with Pegasus I found the planes to be clean and modern and the legroom wasn't too bad. The only problem was not checking in online all the way to Antalya so we had to collect our luggage and re-check in at Istanbul.,4/14/2013,4,4,3,3,4,8
A Fahey,0,Sydney - Christchurch - Sydney. The flight over was acceptable with service pretty poor only one choice left out of two for the meal only one side of the sound in my headphones for IFE worked. Seats were cramped and uncomfortable. Flight back was poor. Flight was an hour late departing although they made up a lot of that time. Staff are quite rude tending to order you around and not showing much interest in customer comfort. My seat had a great big lump in the back like a spring had come loose or something. It was very uncomfortable. I told the FA who wasn't very interested but said she'd see if anything else was available after we took off. I told her I'd like to sit with my wife and she said 'its only a couple of hours so put up with it. It was so uncomfortable I'm not sure what I would have done if it had been a longer haul. food was OK had a choice this time IFE OK.,2/28/2014,2,1,3,3,2,5
Alan Wan,1,EDI-LCY on time. E170 comfortable like the 2x2 seating free bar and some snacks although the FA missed me and my neighbour. I chose with route as I thought of the connections to London Bridge station I must say the DLR and particularly the Jubilee line was rather slow - I figured it might have been quicker to go via LGW.,3/4/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Wilson,0,"BKK-OSL-BKK DY7201 19 Oct. DY7202 3 Nov. Never again. The ""premium cabin"" had 5 seats sold in it the day before. Come boarding time they had filled the cabin by upgrading economy passengers. I don't have a big problem with this but come the meal service time the FAs made it easy on themselves by just handing out economy meals to everyone. The breakfast was an alleged premium product but was unfortunately the worst airline food stale does not begin to describe the pain au chocolat. Not at all impressed with the fancy windows that don't black out properly on the Dreamliner. For the same price as premium economy with Norwegian I've since flown Emirates and Qatar business out and economy back and find that to be much better value.",2/26/2014,1,3,1,2,1,1
A Littlejohn,1,I travelled today from Alicante to Manchester on flight LS880. All I can say is that whilst the flight had a brief delay through no fault of the airline the cabin crew were the most helpful and friendly that I have come across on any airline.,12/29/2013,4,3,4,NaN,5,9
Alan Wan,1,Flew LHR-DOH-DAC. The trip started at the Qatar Business lounge at T4. I thought the lounge was excellent. Food service comfort all first rate. The first flight was on an A319 all business class. The plane feels very exclusive and the level of service and attention was superb. However as a solo traveller I would opt for a different aircraft if possible which allows every passenger direct aisle access. Saying that I sat on the aisle and my neighbour sitting at the window never woke me up getting to the loo. The food was the best I have experienced on a flight. The food I had particularly the main course - lamb with couscous were superb. The flight departed and arrived an hour late but on this occasion this was no problem as I had quite a long layover at Doha. The plane parked on a remote stand and we were bussed on a limo-coach type of coach. It was equipped with 12 spacious sofas. There was no queue at the transit security they x-rayed our bags and I was through to the Al Mourjan lounge within minutes. The lounge is huge with plenty of space to sit I found a sofa to lie down for a few hours before taking a shower and having lunch at the upstairs restaurant. This was a buffet affair rather than cook to order at LHR. Overall I cant knock the lounge it was lovely but I much preferred the LHR lounge it felt more exclusive and the food offering was much better. Unfortunately my flight was delayed by +2 hours and ended up eating again at the lounge. I tried the downstairs restaurant but it only served cold food so returned to the upstairs restaurant. I departed from gate A8 which took about 10 minutes to get to. Amazingly I was the only passenger in Business Class there are 30 seats in the Business cabin of the A330-300 and it was weird having 29 empty seats and 5 FAs to look after me. I had a glass of excellent Billicart Salmon Brut champagne as a pre-flight drink then a fabulous St Clair Sav Blanc with my meal. I chose the mushroom and basil oil soup followed by a rump of lamb. I was too full for a any dessert The food was not as good as the first flight and as expected for a 4 hour flight it was a three course meal rather than a seven course banquet. We arrived just after 2am and I was through immigration in no time. Mainly as there were so few passengers requiring to complete visa on arrival. The hotel had arranged for a fixer to collect me and deliver me to the car pick up point where the hotel mini-van was there to collect me.,2/24/2015,5,5,4,5,5,9
A Feio,1,GIG-CDG-LIS AF443 Rio de Janeiro to Lisbon via Paris Charles de Gaulle Boeing 777-300ER brand new aircraft friendly cabin crew very poor seat comfort for an 11 hour overnight transatlantic flight. Just 2 meals during the flight after 2 hours all the crew disappear to go and have a rest on the back of the plane as you see them 3 hours prior to landing waking up and tidy up themselves. They just give you a poor amount of juices and no food at all just ice creams. IFE very good and a good selection of movies as the screen is big enough. Very poor seat comfort in economy you hardly can pull down your chair. Overall is a good value for price flying with Air France don't expect something excellent. They should look after the standards followed by KLM as they are in a partnership which is an excellent choice for a long haul flights!,6/8/2014,4,2,3,5,3,6
A Locke,1,"I flew from Columbus Ohio to Trenton New Jersey a few weeks ago and had a good experience. I was worried because of the unfavourable reviews but I was pleasantly surprised with the experience. Frontier is your typical ""no-frills"" airline. You do have to pay for a snack but for the price I paid for the flight I wasn't complaining about that. The position of the seats was a tad uncomfortable however my flight was short so it wasn't too much of a problem for me. The staff and flight attendants were helpful and friendly and there were no delays on either flight. In fact the return flight arrived early. In my opinion Frontier is a good value and I would fly with them again.",6/5/2013,5,3,0,0,4,9
A Wilson,1,Flew from LHR to TXL on 14/7/14. Could not complain about a single aspect of this flight considering it was just over an hour paid extra for seat choice and a snack and both went off without a hitch. Departed on time and landed on time staff were fine everything was fine. Will look at flying Germanwings again should I have cause to return to Germany.,7/25/2014,5,4,3,0,4,10
A Winarski,0,AC 1881 Feb 12 2014 Sarasota to Toronto. Delayed 4.5 to 5 hours as of now. No considerations to passengers. JetBlue also delayed but they brought in pizza and drinks for their passengers. Many considerations to those that smoke to leave the secure area but no food. All the kiosks have been closed at this airport by 6 pm!,2/14/2014,1,1,1,1,2,1
A Feregrino,1,I honestly can't complain. We paid for seats that didn't have much legroom. Because they were only $3. I would say we got what we paid for. Nothing was complimentary other than the water. The flight attendants were nice and we got from LAX to Denver right on time. We paid for carry on. We followed the instructions on measurements and weight of our luggage. We had no problems whatsoever.,12/1/2014,5,3,3,0,5,9
Alan Ward,1,I flew from London (LGW) to Jakarta (CGK) in Seat 6A and really enjoyed my flight. It was via Amsterdam and delays were involved but overall we weren't that late arriving here in Jakarta around midday. The aircraft was clean and all crew were professional and friendly and the meals were exceptionally good. I have an issue with Garuda in that seem unable to sell me a ticket for this flight but originating in Cardiff (CWL) so I could join the long haul sector in Amsterdam. It seems ridiculous that two SkyTeam members can't co-operate better. Even KLM Gold Elite Plus members are denied lounge access in Jakarta but not elsewhere in Indonesia on Garuda economy domestic flights.,10/20/2014,5,5,5,2,5,10
A Longden,0,On 2 legs of a 4 leg trip the airline did not have enough food choices to accommodate business class passengers which is unacceptable. On one leg (Doha to London) several women who were seated in business class but had children in economy class - these children were allowed to repeatedly run through business class cabin disturbing other passengers. These passengers also repeatedly ignored safety instructions viz seatbelt signs and mobile phone regulations. Overall flights were on time and otherwise comfortable. We would also comment that the boarding arrangements at Colombo were complete chaos with no separate boarding for premium passengers - a total free for all. Finally on one leg (London to Doha) my wife's inflight entertainment had no sound.,2/11/2014,3,4,1,4,1,4
A Withey,0,June 17th and back on the 25t. I bought my bundle ticket through Expedia and regretted flying on Spirit when I found out I was going to be charged 150.00 going and another 150.00 coming back for carry on luggage. Service was horrible. They charged for even a cup of coffee. Seats did not go back and no videos while we flew. I wish I could give less than a one.,7/3/2014,1,1,1,1,1,1
Alan Ward,1,LHR-MCT-SLL-MCT-LHR. A330-300 sectors in comfortable new aircraft with great leg space. Satisfactory food and drinks with bottled water available thoughout flight. Biscuits and ice cream on return flight. GF main course served to my wife was bland on both sectors but happily exchanged by crew for biryani on return sector. B737-800 sectors both satisfactory with GF meals served on these 1hr flights.

A Ferguson,1,MAD-GRU First Class July 16th 2012. Extremely friendly check in staff at Madrid Barajas was a good start. Lounge is a shared one for multiple airlines and a bit downbeat. First Class passengers can board early and if so are provided with quality drinks and tasty snacks. Plane was fully boarded 30 minutes before departure despite being 100% full and departed 20 mins early. Delicious light healthy meal and slept for over 6 hours. Early departure ensured we were the first plane to land early morning at 04.30 in GRU allowing me to beat the dreaded immigration queues and be downtown by 05.45. Return flight next day was equally good and First lounge a haven from the horrors of GRU. Plan was at remote stand and was driven to the plane as the lone F passenger. Excellent Brazilian dishes on board in addition to a really good top quality wine selection. AVOD was ok . Slept comfortably for 7 hours. Overall great crew and ground staff that make a real difference. Will fly TAM again whenever I get the chance.,7/25/2012,4,4,4,3,5,10
A Wong,1,Flew Melbourne to Bangkok on the slightly midnight flight and were very impressed with the on board service. We were greeted on board by the friendly staff using the traditional Thai greeting. Shortly after take off hot towels were handed out and an actual dinner was served. Staff were friendly and very professional and drinks were offered frequently and drink orders were promptly on request. Excellent on board entertainment system with a broad spectrum new release movies and TV shows to cater to every taste. Toilets were clean and seats were comfortable with a good pitch. Staff also went through the cabin frequently to collect rubbish. All food served was tasty and was not too spicy. On our return flight from Bangkok to Melbourne which left at 9.10 the service was again excellent and faultless. Definitely one of the premium full service airlines and has a slight edge over Malaysia Airlines in terms of food and on board entertainment.,1/8/2014,5,4,5,5,5,10
A Lovejoy,1,Returning home from Boston (to Ogdensburg) severe fog did not permit take-off of Cape-Air's small plane. Several people absolutely had to get home that night. Cape Air went above and beyond. They re-booked all of us on an outbound flight from Logan to Albany then hired a driver in an uber-comfy shuttle van to drive everyone the rest of the way to Ogdensburg. Long journey and not quite what any of us was anticipating that day but cannot say enough about the service and kindness of the Cape Air staff.,7/23/2013,0,0,0,0,0,10
Alanna Finn,0,This experience has been disgusting. I was flying from Newark NJ to London to grab a connecting flight to get to Dublin. The original flight was delayed 3 hours which wouldn't be so bad if someone would have properly advised us about the following connection. Due to the total lack of communication I proceeded to miss my connecting flight because United failed to give me the information I needed to make it on time. I will never fly with this airline again.,5/24/2014,1,4,3,3,1,1
A Wood,0,"LHR to Miami return. Where to start. New logo - but old plane old staff old service. 'Turkey slider' in business class? Pre-formed mush. Surly badly dressed cabin crew.

Even worse lounge in Miami - two vouchers for free drinks - for Â£4k? 13 year old 777 noisy  flat bed only goes down part way and worst of all - no laptop power adapters available ""We've stopped providing them""! Well you know what I've stopped using AA.",9/1/2014,1,1,1,1,1,1
A Fiddies,0,Flew Manchester-Gran Canaria. Good flight times and got baggage quickly. Attempting to print off the boarding pass scam was painful to say the least. In the UK the site kept crashing and took the best part of a day to achieve the process only to have to repeat this in our holiday destination. When at Manchester airport it was displayed that boarding for our flight was in 5 minutes this continued for about 25 minutes with no updates. We were then requested to proceed to boarding that I can only explain as a cattle market. We were then left to wait in the queue for the best part of another 45 minutes. Consequently our flight was delayed by well over an hour with no explanation or apology. Whilst on the flight to Gran Canaria the seat belt sign light was displayed intermittently for long periods with no evidence of turbulence or explanation. Being 2 adults we could manage this but we had to feel for the passengers with young children who desperately wanted the toilet. Baggage - the allowance is 15 kilos for hold luggage and 10 for hand luggage. When we flew out from Manchester they counted hand luggage in our allowance. On return from Gran Canaria they decided that hold luggage should only be 15 kilos. Our hold luggage weighed exactly the same as it did at Manchester and we did not have hand luggage but were told that it would cost us 70 euros to pay the excess. Having very little hand luggage facilities available we had to empty our case to avoid the excess charge. Admittedly we should have read the small print but one would question why this was not highlighted in Manchester and came to light in Gran Canaria on our return. Overall it may be a budget airline but really not worth the hassle.,6/18/2014,1,1,1,NaN,1,1
A Lucey,0,London Heathrow to Bahrain 8th Dec 2011 at 21.50. Cabin dirty headset didn't work no inflight entertainment and staff terse. Third time in the last year I have travelled with Gulf Air and usually very good but this was poor.,12/10/2011,2,4,3,1,2,3
Alasdair Brooks,1,"DXB-KBP-LGW. Both planes were 737-800s but the seating was not identical. On the Dubai-Kiev leg the seating was cramped my knees were knocking the seatback pocket and anyone much taller than me (178 cm / 5'10"") would likely have found it very uncomfortable. The Kiev-Gatwick leg however offered what was clearly roomier seating with minimal knee-seat contact. The latter seating also seemed slightly more frayed; I gained the impression that slightly better legroom was in the older plane. Otherwise there's no getting around the fact that despite being Ukraine's national airline UIA are also a budget airline with no in-flight entertainment and no free food (only limited food options for a cost) on short or medium-haul flights - which includes Dubai-Kiev. If you go into the flight knowing this then the really competitive cost makes UIA worth considering as the flights seem to be punctual staff are professional and transiting at the UIA-dedicated Terminal D at Boryspil is easy fast and painless. If you go into a short- or medium-haul route with UIA expecting full service from a national airline then you'll likely be disappointed. I imagine that the Skytrax 2-star rating reflects the lack of entertainment and limited food options - but judge UIA as a budget airline and they're better than many of their European competitors in the similar price bracket and I've had much worse experiences with full-service North American airlines on (internal) flights of similar length to my individual legs here. If I had to keep costs down on a route covered by UIA's network I'd certainly consider them again.",4/10/2015,5,3,2,1,4,7

A Findlay,0,LHR-EWR and back. You do get what you pay for with this airline but they really should do something to improve on the overall quality of their planes and service. The 757s look extremely dated now - once white plastic fascias now looking grey/brown. Curtain divider between Economy and Business a tatty net curtain that doesn't cover the width of the doorway. On both flights the toilet illumination signs were flickering constantly and added to the air of shabbyness. The only long haul airline I have flown in the last 5 years where in Economy you do not get any inflight entertainment system. All you get is films on a loop. I had to wait 20mins for the loop to start again. Flew LHR-SFO last October and on the EWR-LHR route this time the same film selection was playing as in October. Particularly galling as I paid a cheaper price for a trip to Thailand on Thai Airways last year and the IFE was excellent. Staff whilst pleasant are genuinely uninterested took 10 mins to answer my call to ask them to get my bag out of the overhead locker as the passengers either side of me were asleep. You have to pay for the alcoholic beverages - $7 for a 125ml bottle of red wine is an unbelievable rip off. The seat was the most uncomfortable seat I have sat in with the exception of Ryanair where you expect an uncomfortable ride. On the plus side there is an extremely good availability of economy plus seats and the legroom really is superb in these seats but this does not make up for the overall comfort of the seat. The price to upgrade to Economy plus is the same as paying for an extra legroom seat on Virgin Atlantic and is less than half as good.,6/5/2014,1,1,1,1,1,1
A Yates,0,Flew Scoot Sydney to Singapore 2pm flight. Checked in at 12 and told flight was delayed 2 hours. Boards showed flight boarding so went to boarding gate only to be told flight was delayed again - no one knew why. 2 hours later we got to board. Sat on the plane for almost an hour before we took off. My first son flew two weeks later - his flight was delayed by an hour - boarding was chaotic whilst every friend and his brother tried to rush onto the plane irrespective of a zone call. My daughter in law flew in last week Friday. Arrival time was 7pm. Looking online we saw the flight was delayed by 2 hours. We arrived at the airport at 9pm - flight board showed arrival as 9.15pm. At 9.30pm arrival time was changed to 10.22pm! Delayed 3.5 hours! Hugely unimpressed with Scoot.,2/26/2013,1,3,1,1,3,NaN
Alasdair Lawson,0,My son arrived for his Jet2 flight from Leeds/Bradford to Venice more than 45 minutes before departure (Jet 2 state check in should be a minimum 40 minutes before) and was promptly told he wasn't allowed to board. Whilst I appreciate this was cutting it a bit fine there was sufficient time to check his bag in and he had already paid to check in online! Not very impressed with the pedantic staff or the various additional charges added to the advertised ticket price. Unfortunately my son had to book another Jet2 flight this time from Newcastle in order to get to his destination today. This will definitely be the last as neither he nor I will use this airline again!,7/22/2012,3,0,0,NaN,1,2
A Maayer,1,VIE-HEL-SIN E90/A340. Delays because of storms in Vienna and 60 min connection in HEL was pending. Finnair offered a rebooking to Emirates if I would miss my connection in HEL. As the delay was only 30min and HEL confirmed to wait for me I took the planned flight. I made the 30min connection even the luggage did. A340 a bit old inside seats are not flat but okay for sleeping. Crew professional but not overly heartily. Food good wine selection very good.,6/15/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Macarron,1,MAD-BRU-NBO return with my Miles & More miles. Short haul flights on old 737s but cabins were clean and decent. We were on b-flex economy so were offered a meal which was nice. Long haul on A330-300 with nice pitch but no IFE which would have made a big difference and ok meals. Cabin crews very good except for NBO-BRU where more veteran FAs not so nice. Overall a reliable airline with acceptable service.,4/20/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,7
A Firmansyah,0,EK231 April 14 2014. Overall experience: unsatisfactory rude flight attendants. My first time flying economy class with Emirates and I will never use them again. Flight attendants were rude when serving meals. My wife was asked what kind of food she would like and she said chicken. In a rude tone the flight attendant said they were out of chicken and only had vegetarian while throwing the meal to my wife. When serving the second meals (breakfast) the same thing happened. Finally she came back with the food of our choice.,4/16/2014,2,4,2,1,1,2
A Yeraliyev,1,URA-PEK via ALA return in Y. Checked-in online but offered a better seat at the airport which is nice of check-in agents. Domestic legs on newish A319 with plenty of legroom in economy. ALA-PEK on rather tired B767 with ancient bulky ceiling TV-sets and stale interiors but the flight and service very good. Had seats 29A+B for myself (exit row seats) on both flights with huge legroom. Special meal delivered as requested. ALA-PEK-ALA are the night flights so service was unobtrusive if you like which is good for couple of hours sleep. Excellent experience with Air Astana (although no competition whatsoever in the local market therefore fares are quite expensive.,6/21/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
Alastair Birkett,1,MH1 London to KL 11th Dec 2013 on A380. Fantastic experience for the moment I arrived at check in until I disembarked at KL. I missed my original flight (MH3) due to fog at London and was re-booked onto MH1. Lounge staff made the 8 hour wait a pleasure! The crew on the flight were excellent as was the food and service. (I was addressed by name frequently). The drinks just kept coming. The food was outstanding the best business food I have had large portions and each component cooked separately and assembled on the plate not all heated together on the same plate and served. They had taken time with the food and it showed. Very comfortable and roomy seats I am 6 feet 1 inch tall and had no issues at all even managed 6 hours sleep no problem with the bed comfort. If you are looking for a quality business product at an affordable price look no further.,12/16/2013,5,5,5,5,5,10
A Macharia,0,It was a Mombasa-Nairobi flight schedule to leave at 1440h so we arrived at the airport by 1315h and checked in they did not say one word to us about the delay. They didn't tell us anything but simply put it up on the board after we had waited for 2 hrs already without any announcement or explanation. Of course it did not leave until 1840h. KQ will allow you to book and check in then they will not service the flight leaving you effectively grounded and waiting for up to 5 hrs for a local flight. Pure inefficiency.,8/1/2011,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Yong,1,"BHX-ZRH-SIN return. Swiss has made some subtle but noticeable improvements to their longhaul inflight product since my last flight with them in 2013. Menus are now provided, proper metal cutlery is now used, meals taste better and the crew on all four flights seemed friendlier than before. Still no amenity kits provided on a 12-hour flight. IFE is still dreadful and the A340 cabin is woefully out of date with no power points and huge IFE boxes under some seats. I recommend seats 24A and 24K to avoid the boxes if you want a window seat. As per usual with Swiss, all flights were impeccably on-time and Zurich is a joy to transit through.",6/13/2015,4,3,4,2,5,8
A Fischer,1,The most comfortable seats now in the new A330-300 in business as well as in economy the entertainment system actually works (though your own headset might be a bit better than the Lufthansa one in coach) and delicious food in business plus the usual chicken or pasta (sorry pasta is out) in coach. Don't worry the chicken is fine. What do you want more for your money? I did continue on Air Canada with expensive poor food in domestic headset you pay for but which do not work is that really necessary to save cost? I would rather fly on Lufthansa.,8/26/2014,5,5,5,5,5,10
Alastair Finch,1,Travelled EK18 MAN-DXB and EK420 on to Perth. A380 excellent - beautiful plane smooth and quiet. In business class service was patchy - better on my wife's side than mine my attendant disappeared half way through.

A Mackenzie,1,"Is it me or are former first class airlines morphing into 'Low Cost Carriers'? Well it certainly felt like it when travelling 'Plus' class with SAS from Heathrow T2 to Copenhagen T3 on a Thursday afternoon. Although the passenger enjoys certain advantages in 'Plus' this is lost during the actual journey. Crammed together in seats the same as economy, there was no spare middle seat, and the tight pitch revealed itself when the person in front of me reclined his seat. I mean if one is paying extra it should manifest in a more comfortable passage.",7/3/2015,2,1,3,NaN,4,5
Alastair Finch,1,Travelled from LPL to DUB and back. Quick check in very efficient boarding only quibble being the very tight leg room.

A Young,0,"My husband and I decided to take a spontaneous trip to San Francisco for my birthday. As we were making travel arrangements to return back to the Miami area JetBlue had the only flight that worked with our time schedule. We were hesitant to book the flight with JetBlue because we did not know much about the company. We decided to give JetBlue a chance and booked flight #578 from SFO to FLL on March 14 2015. It is unfortunate that we did not have a good experience on our first JetBlue flight. The electrical system had issues. The TV on the back of the seats worked at the beginning of the flight but slowly the TVs started going out throughout the cabin (our row did not have a working TV the majority of the 5 hour flight). This made me question what other electrical issues this plane might have. Not only did we have electrical issues but we did not have running water on the flight. My husband and I are both in the medical field and we feel this is not only inconvenient but unsanitary. The ""solution"" was to place multiple bottles of water in the restroom for customers to wash their hands. Partially used and soiled water bottles to wash our hands is not exactly our idea of sanitary. Since the plane did not have running water my husband and I decided to avoid using the restroom for over a 5 hour flight. It also made us question the cleanliness of the flight attendants' hands provided the lack of water on the plane. This is a huge unsanitary issue that should never occur on a plane.",3/28/2015,1,3,1,1,1,NaN
A Fitzpatrick,1,LHR via MCT to Mumbai return. Good: leg room entertainment some in-flight staff. Poor: airline staff at Muscat were disorganised and unfriendly. Ground staff member at Heathrow was friendly but told us he'd given us emergency exit seats for the flight (my co-passenger is 6ft 4) and this turned out to be completely untrue. Had the feeling that if anything went wrong e.g. in-flight entertainment stopped working you'd be on your own. Food was poor. Delayed twice by one hour each time. No explanation for one delay the other was because the plane was 'waiting for important papers' for an hour once we had boarded. Muscat airport is small for a stopover but new airport is under construction.,3/21/2013,3,4,2,4,2,5
Al-Bayyari Moath,1,Abu Dhabi (AUH) to London Heathrow (LHR). Etihad requires the passenger to check in at the airport at least 1.5 hrs before the flight. As you approach the airport the streets are filled with signs to guide you on where to go. When you reach workers with trolleys will be waiting for you to help with the luggage. While you're entering the terminal the security check is after the luggage check therefore it will be comfortable for the passenger to go through security without having to worry about the luggage. After the security check and when you are ready to board you will walk through a fairly small duty free which requires improvement. The shops were not organized and small and the food court is very small and does not have the variety that would make the passengers have a good experience at the airport. I boarded the Boeing 777 which was very large compared to the other airplanes I went on. There are two lines before you enter a line for economy class and the other for business and first class. The line for economy was much longer than the other line. I did not have to wait because my ticket was a business class ticket. The flight welcomed the passengers with smiles which was a great start. The passenger is guided to his seat and helped with placing his hand luggage. The seats were small as my expectations were higher for a highly priced ticket that cost 8130 AED. However as the plane took off and the passengers were allowed to move the seats it turned out to be very comfortable as the seats can turn into a bed. The service was very quick and I had access to food at all times during the flight. Overall it was a great flight that I recommend for all.,10/9/2013,4,4,5,5,5,9
A Flores,1,SIN-DVO return. Outbound flight had a slight delay of a few minutes. Inbound flight on time. FA's were attentive and overall experience was ok. I will fly this airline again especially if promo fares are available.,3/12/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Madeira,0,BOM-LHR on 30 March 2014 flight was not so pleasant. Flight departed Mumbai at lunchtime 1pm however lunch was served 2 hours later by which time everyone is starving and hungry. 1 hour into the flight 1 drink and packet of peanuts. Lunch was ok though portion size was very small. During the flight there were 3 rounds of drinks 1 serving per round rest of the time the air hostesses were never around. The final meal was a measly croissant as the main dish. Still not enough for an average human. All in all a starving flight and I arrived hungry. Inflight system was mediocre and leg room is just adequate. In case you want to have a comfortable flight Jet airways is not the flight its definitely not going to be mine.,4/4/2014,3,3,1,1,2,2

A Ford,1,Guernsey to Paris return via Jersey last weekend. Outbound flights and connections went well with great cabin service including champagne lager tea coffee and good quality rolls and snacks. Return flight was disappointing. An elderly aircraft really showing its age. In fact the seats in the row in front of us were a completely different style to the rest! The air conditioning didn't work which was unfortunate on such a hot day particularly as we had to sit in the plane on the tarmac at Paris for around 25 mins. Some of the no-smoking signs didn't illuminate - not a problem but reinforced the impression of a rather shabby plane. Very cheerful cabin crew. Arrived in Jersey for our connecting flight to Guernsey only to be told it had been cancelled - it was a bank holiday Monday and apparently they never operate that flight on bank holidays and we should never have been able to book it through their website! So what should have been a one hour connection at Jersey turned into 2.5 hours. Again not a huge problem but for an airline that pitches itself as something above the norm it was a bit disappointing. Fares were good value and flight times to and from Paris were convenient (aside from the delay on the return).,5/6/2014,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,7
A Magpantay,1,I loved flying Aegean Air from Rome to Athens in May 2011. Check in was a breeze. The food was warm and good even had dessert. Staff was courteous and helpful. After flying EasyJet for most parts of my 2 week European backpacking trip flying Aegean was a treat.,10/17/2011,5,4,5,3,5,8
Albert Kelley,0,"We fly from KY to FL frequently on Allegiant because the fares are low. However, be prepared for virtually 100% of your flights to depart and arrive late, sometimes an hour or more. Also, if you have to change your itinerary, forget it. Just throw away your ticket since you can not make any changes, even for a fee online. We have waited on hold for hours trying to connect on the phone to a customer service agent only to be disconnected when their automated system tried to connect us to a representative. This happened multiple times. So if a Greyhound bus with wings with no service in the air on on the ground works for you, then Allegiant is your airline. Checking in with luggage is a hour long ordeal as well. The prices w/o extras or luggage are compelling and the experience then is bearable.",6/13/2015,2,1,1,NaN,2,2
A Zawko,0,My son's wedding was in Florida on Jan. 4 2014 so we booked our flights (6 family members) in August for this special occasion. We were scheduled to fly from Knoxville to St. Petersburg/Clearwater on the morning of Jan. 1. Two family members went early to Knoxville and were at a motel on the morning of Jan. 1 when they received a text that the flight was cancelled. The other four of us were on the way to Knoxville when we were called by our family members and told of the cancellation. I spent 45 minutes on hold arranging for new (replacement) tickets from Lexington KY to St. Pete that afternoon. We finally booked the tickets and headed north to Lexington for a 1.15 pm flight. We pulled into the airport and arrived at the ticket counter only to find that the flight was delayed 4 hours. We spent several more hours killing time until the flight took off at 6pm. We arrived at St. Pete too late to get our rental cars. Both the originating flight and the return were operated by Sun Country which seems to be a much better airline. The only thing that made the travel acceptable at all was Sun Country. I will never fly this airline again.,1/7/2014,3,4,4,0,4,NaN
A Forsythe,1,This week on my trip to Seattle I flew Alaska Airlines when in the past I would normally fly United. Alaska Airlines far exceeded my expectations. If I could use them to fly everywhere I would. The flight attendants actually seemed happy and were very nice. The seats were extremely comfortable - much more comfortable than other flights that I've been on. The plane was clean. I will definitely fly with Alaska Airlines anytime I can.,8/26/2014,5,5,5,0,5,10
A Maiden,1,My son and I have just returned from London flying with Royal Brunei. We were especially pleased with the service that we got. The aircraft was very new and the leg room was extra welcome (my son being over 6 foot). The service from cabin crew on the plane and at all checking in areas was excellent. The meals were good and we had a choice of what we could have. The long flight to London was broken by two stops one in Brunei and one in Dubai. These stops were not long so there was no hanging around for hours waiting for the next flight but long enough to walk around and have a good stretch. We originally booked the flight because of the price - it was $1000 less than other airlines at the time of booking but we will certainly fly with them again.,7/1/2014,5,5,4,4,5,9
Albert Vasquez,0,I flew AF 256 on 20/8/13 upgrading to premium economy at CDG for a substantial price. Unfortunately my expectations were not met with what was a less than satisfactory onboard service. On boarding I was allocated seat 21A which I identified immediately was broken I brought this to the attention of the male flight attendant. The seat would not stay in its retracted position and I had concerns that this would not be safe. I was most disappointed when this was not dealt with. He returned to say that it would be ok and continued on. The service in general in prem-Eco was less than satisfactory. On arrival into SIN and deplaning I brought it to the attention of the female cabin crew positioned between pre-Eco / economy and asked that it be reviewed prior to the return flight to Paris. She stated that her flight was finished and it was not her problem. It is for this reason that I would not consider flying Air France again.,9/10/2013,1,3,1,3,1,1
A Zweigart,1,I've flown on SATA Air Acores round-trip to Terceira Ponta Delgado and Lisbon at least 10 times. Service has always been excellent with flight attendants and pilots who spoke Portuguese andEnglish fluently. They make you feel welcome and do everything they can to make your flight comfortable and enjoyable. All of the flights have been on-time or at the latest within 15 minutes of scheduled departure/arrival time. The only complaint that I have is that the ticket prices have sky-rocketed! If I were wealthy I wouldn't have any complaints at all about SATA!,4/22/2015,0,0,0,0,0,8
A Fox,1,LHR-SIN-PER return. First leg fantastic upstairs economy on the A380 flight half full with plenty of room stretch out flight attendants friendly attentive very enjoyable. Both legs to and from Perth comfortable enough but nothing to rave about. Return from Singapore was terrible. Boarding call for flight was a late and all classes families with children etc. we're called within in minutes apart total chaos ensued. First class business and economy all cramming in a rush to get on felt like budget airline experience. Flight was full with no room to move attendants stretched to handle the demands of anxious late night passengers lots of small children it's a thin line between a good and a bad flight in economy when full. Still the better economy airline for long haul.,12/7/2013,4,3,5,3,5,7
A Main,0,Just back from a delayed flight due to volcano. Older plane meant not very comfy 9 hours to Amsterdam from Orlando. We were left at Amsterdam for a gruelling 11 hours with no food or any offer of drinks - we had 3 grandchildren with us so a very tiring day and also very costly experience. Spoke to staff who were not very helpful.,5/3/2010,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,4
Alberto Lugo Vina,0,VN231 outbound and VN272 return. Vietnam is perhaps one of the most enchanting countries in Asia I have yet to experience yet Vietnam Airlines leaves very little to be desired - and it has everything to do with the small details from all areas ranging from their print media / safety on board video to the ever so important quality of customer service. Service in the airport and during the flight - lack of willingness to help perceived as aggressive - not customer oriented or empathetic to the needs of the customer. Food quality - Average/Normal in quality and variety. Not necessarily a critical element at this stage as there are other more significant issues at hand. Communications/Language - Poor. For an international airline this is perhaps one of the poorest airlines I have experienced in terms of listening and communicating English to international guests.,12/22/2014,4,4,3,2,1,1
Aadi Achint,0,Flew with them this week between Bangalore Chandigarh and back to Bangalore. I feel the airline has potential if handled properly. The ground staff leave a lot to be desired. Our flight from Bangalore although boarded on time the crew could not clear for quite a while. Pilot seemed to take each thing at a time effecting delay. The return leg was further confusion as fog delayed the incoming flight but no one was interested to let the passengers know the same. No announcements. Also in the aircraft the crew just forgot to ask all to switch off the phones. If it is not much of a problem then why push for it all other times. Where is the safety when the announcements were not completed. No smoking announcement not made. Some positives though. Good pricing strategy. Fresh aircraft and good potential if staff improve.,12/22/2014,3,2,3,1,1,2
A Frankel,0,They change the schedule of the flight ok that happens. They send an email informing people. However if you do not respond to the email your reservation is lost in the system. Took 30 minutes to recover the reservation. Flight was 30 minutes late. I heard about people who had 5 hour delays on a 45 minute (max) flight. Incredibly strict policy on carry-ons. Bags have to fit into a box and the agent has to see it go in in order to be approved. Woefully understaffed counter - for over 30 minutes there was only one person working the counter.,3/3/2014,1,3,1,1,1,1
Alden Hiett,1,Round-trip Flight from Atlanta to PVG in June. Seats were full recline and comfortable on 777-200. Flight attendants attentive and no problems with speaking or understanding English.

A Makiol,1,Flew BNE-ICN-LAX JFK-ICN-BNE in November. This is my second trip with Korean Air this year and I am still very impressed with them. Service provided from the cabin crew is excellent nothing is an issue and always greeted with a smile. Aircraft are always clean tidy and modern. I loved the A380 so spacious the most room I've ever had in economy class! AVOD is great and meals are fine with regular water/juice runs throughout all flights. Korean Air is a consistent airline which I think is very important I will continue to support them as they offer a great product at a great price. I look forward to my flights next year and would highly recommend.,12/13/2013,5,4,4,4,5,9
A Freeman,1,First time travelling in business class on a flight from MEL to MCY. Cabin supervisor was polite very approachable and looked after the needs of all in business. Nothing was too much trouble for any of the crew members. Comfortable seats great spread of food and endless drinks. The Samsung player was good. First one was low on battery but was quickly replaced. Headphones were of sufficient standard. However I did end up swapping for my own personal set.

Aaron Agmata,0,6/24/14 on a round trip from Honolulu to Denver. I arrived at HNL airport before the recommended 2 hour time prior to take off. Upon my arrival I noticed that the plane was already at the gate. They loaded the first group of passengers and then the gate personnel said that there was a problem with the air conditioning so everyone had to deplane. This plane was at the gate for over 2 hours and no one noticed that the AC was out? We finally take off 1.5 hrs late. We arrived at Phoenix and I had to run to my next connection gate. I barely made my connection flight to Denver but my carry-on which I was told to check at the gate because there was no room on the plane did not make it. My return trip back to Honolulu was even worse. Again I got to the airport 2 hours prior to boarding. A plane was at the gate but the gate agent told me that it wasn't my flight. The gate agent assured me that this would be the gate for boarding. Half hour prior to boarding the gate agent tells everyone that we need to switch gates then we had to wait another half hour for another plane to taxi out of the gate. When my flight finally arrived at the gate it was discovered that one of the rear emergency masks was faulty. Again we have to wait. We are finally allowed to board on the plane a half hour after the scheduled boarding time to wait another two hours to take off. First the pilot says they have to refuel then we couldn't take off because of weather. This caused me to miss my connection flight to Honolulu from Phoenix. While I was waiting to take off I get an email from US Airways that due to the delay and me missing my connection flight I was being moved to another flight connecting from PHX to LAX and then to HNL but the flight wasn't until the next day and no mention of them paying for a place for me to stay. My wife was able to convince an agent to put me on an American Air flight that would get me back to Hawaii on that day. I will never fly US Airways again.,7/13/2014,4,4,0,1,2,NaN

A Malkowski,1,"Vancouver to Beijing and Shanghai to Vancouver with 3 domestic flights: Beijing to Xi'an; Xi'an to Wuhan and Chongqing to Shanghai and was mostly satisfied. The long haul flights had pillows, blankets and headsets prepared on each seat. Three meals were provided with some choice and were decent by airline standards. A glass of wine was included with the main meal. Water was offered on a regular basis. Tea, coffee and soft drinks also available. Good selection of Chinese, International and Hollywood movies as well as games, e-books and other entertainment. On arrival in Shanghai Pudong we learnt that our ongoing flight to Beijing had been cancelled due to bad weather. Although we were transferred to an earlier flight we had to collect our luggage and collect new boarding passes which had already been prepared. This process was somewhat confusing and the boarding passes lay on the counter like a deck of cards with passengers randomly going through them to find their own. The information board showed that the new flight was delayed with no ETD or whether it would even be leaving that day. A rep came to explain the situation. He spent 10 minutes giving a Chinese explanation and in English, simply said we do not know. Suddenly he received a call on his mobile and said we may be boarding. After a mad rush to the gate it transpired that this was not the case after all and everyone returned to what seats were available, or the floor. Half an hour later the flight was officially called and we were on our way. The shorter, domestic flights offer food service but no entertainment. On one occasion we experienced a 2 hour delay after we had boarded the plane, due to a sudden storm. Dinner was served during this delay, before take off, and was a good use of time. I do not know what the flights cost as they were part of a tour package, but based on service and comfort I would recommend China Eastern Airlines.",6/19/2015,3,3,3,4,4,7
A Freud,1,I had the pleasure to travel on new B747-8i from Frankfurt to Washington Dulles and back to Munich on Airbus - both equipped with the new seats. There's a big difference to the old ones! The seat is stylish and completely flat. Inflight movie selection is great now as well as the earphones. What I like most about Lufthansa is their efficient consistent and very friendly service onboard. The food was like a restaurant. Wine selection fine but could be better and wider. Unfortunately they don't offer cappuccino or espresso. Business lounges are a great plus. Staff at US airports should be trained to be friendlier.,5/28/2014,4,5,5,5,5,9

Aaron Edy,0,"This is my 3rd flight with BA in 8 months and  the worst yet. The customer service and communication is appalling. Originally my return flight was from Rome to London Gatwick but my flight was cancelled due to issues at Rome airport. But instead of BA getting in contact with me in regards to this, the third party company I booked the flights with had to. When Checking in they tried to charge me for baggage again although already paid for. When I  spoke to them on the phone, they just tried to fob me off to other numbers even though I called the Customer Service number. This is a shame because for once the actual flight and flight service was good which is surprising.

A Gaitan,0,Flew New York to Las Vegas - October 22nd flight #45. IÂ´m really surprised that American is not considered Low Cost. First you must do your own check in and pay $25 for your first luggage. Second you have to paid extra if you want a comfortable seat. I paid $59 to stretch my legs and I choose the first row after business class. There was a division panel so in fact there wasn't much room. Third in 5 hours flight only 1 complimentary drink and if you want food have to pay for it. Fourth They promote the internet onboard but this is not free $4 for email and more if you want to surf the net. The flight boarded with 1 hour and half delay due to a problem with a luggage compartment door. Seated onboard for another hour and then half an hour waiting for our turn to take off after leaving the gate.,11/6/2014,2,1,1,1,2,2

Alec Krznarich,1,"Just returned from a 2 week graduation trip to Europe with 33 of my fellow students and 5 teachers. Outbound we were scheduled to take off around 8:00 PM on a flight from Oakland to Stockholm, but the plane, a Boeing 787, encountered a bird strike as it arrived into Oakland that left the right wing damaged. Crews at Oakland originally believed the damage was easily fixable and we would depart later that night however, the damage ended up being worse than expected, and the plane was deemed unable to fly. Norwegian specially arranged another aircraft operated by HiFly to fly us to Sweden two days later. As it was 3 AM, and knowing that we lived over 2 hours away, Norwegian paid for a hotel for all 39 of us, as well as the transportation to get there and the bus home the following day. Not only that, but the airline paid for a charter bus to get us back to the airport on Friday, and is going to refund each traveler 600 euros. As far as the flights go, the crews on both the flight to Stockholm and the return flight were great.

Aaron Eisenberg,1,Perth to Sydney on a brand new a330-200. Seat and legroom are good. IFE excellent! Had both on demand and live air channels with a large touch screen. The food not the best but the service is great. Arrive before the scheduled time. All together better than what Qantas offer on their not yet refurbished a330-300 and some 200s.,10/1/2014,5,5,3,5,5,8
Aaron Gourley,1,"The ground crew were polite, professional, and cared about trying to make us happy. We had a baby, so we had to go to the transfers desk to print our boarding passes. They helped us bypass long lines so that we could make our connection on time. Because we were boarding from a connecting flight we weren't able to arrive early enough to claim the bassinet seating (there were lots of babies on the plane) but the flight hostess was able to find another seat for the woman sitting beside my wife, so we had a place to put out 6 month old instead of holding him the whole time. The plane was clean and comfortable, and the food was acceptably good for airplane food. The hostesses were very friendly, professional and presentable. I would recommend this airline.",7/5/2015,5,5,5,5,5,9
A Gaitan,0,AEP-BRC-AEP. Both flights with 1 hour delay. 2 hrs 20 mins flight and catering is a joke (small box with mini snacks). The cabin was dirty in Bariloche for the flight back. My seat was covered with napkins and crumbs. It seems that they don't clean the airplanes in destinations outside Buenos Aires.,3/13/2012,3,3,2,3,4,4
A Mankowski,0,"Since Hawaiian Airlines began charging a fee for checked bags the volume of carry-on luggage has become quite unreasonable. Last month ny husband and I traveled first class from Portland to Honolulu and back. As first class passengers and because my husband uses a wheelchair we boarded first. When the coach passengers began to board my husband and I were literally smacked in the head and shoulders with carry-on luggage - large tote bags overloaded backpacks and even a child safety seat. We had to lean into the space between the seats in order to avoid injury. When I got home I contacted Hawaiian Airlines ""customer advocacy"" program because I wanted to report my experience. A very bored representative took my report and told me someone would get back to me. Three weeks later I had not heard a word from the company. I called again. This time a super-rude rep with minimal language skills told me they had no record of my prior call. When I began again to explain about being smacked in the head and shoulders by carry-on luggage she said 'Well I sorry you have inconvenience"". Now that Alaska Airlines is flying non-stop from Portland to Honolulu I will never fly Hawaiian Airlines again.",4/12/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,6

Aaron Wortham,0,"I'm extremely unimpressed with Spirit Airlines. I understand that they're trying to be a low cost budget airline, but I still believe that it's reasonable to expect some level of competency. First, the flight really isn't that much cheaper, if it is cheaper at all. You have to pay for every piece of luggage (except for 1 backpack), plus seats if you don't want a random seat, and drinks (including water). If you're 6'4"" like me, the only seats that really fit you are the exit row seats, which run you between $20 and $40. One checked bag is $40 per trip (which was actually cheaper than bringing a carry-on for the flight I took). Plus drinks are another $2-4. Which means, if you have a lay-over and you're doing a round-trip, you'll be spending about $100 more for the flight, which makes it just as expensive as any other airline that isn't trying to be ultra-budget (at least for the flight I took). Combine the cost with the fact that they had to cancel one of my connecting flights, making me a whole day late, and top it all off with their really annoying advertising, and what you'll get is a very annoying trip. My recomendation: don't fly Spirit. ",7/29/2015,1,1,1,1,1,1
A Marais,1,I flew from Johannesburg to Hong Kong on August 1st 2014. Service provided by the cabin crew member who was working on my aisle was excellent. He was very friendly and professional. Went to the galley area during the long flight to stretch. The cabin crew member working there at the time was very unfriendly and almost rude. Later when asking another cabin crew member for a drink in the same galley area I was met with a dry expression handed my drink I said 'thank you' with no acknowledgement from this crew member not even a smile. The overall product is quite good delicious food huge selection of drinks often very good service. However there are also extremely rude and unprofessional staff. This is not an isolated experience. Before landing one of the crew members complained to the purser about the cabin crew on the flight. He expressed his views in detail with passengers nearby. This crew member spoke so loudly that it was impossible not to hear him. I found this extremely unprofessional to say the least. It was very unsettling.,8/8/2014,4,4,4,4,3,7
A Galiano,0,I have flown Delta for 20 years and the last few have become completely horrible. The company does not appear to care about the customer any longer. The seats have shrunk to petite size on most flights and I am fairly thin. My knees are in the back of the seat in front of me when I am in coach. The flights are consistently late on departure and arrival. The flights are typically oversold which creates a capacity issue for their service. As a frequent flyer and a business person I can understand the need to increase operating margins but at what cost? I think the executive team should eat their own dog food and ride non-private flights. I am considering abandoning my gold status at Delta for an airline that can do more than lip service.,4/14/2014,1,1,1,1,4,NaN
Alessandro Iglesias,0,Flight from Lisbon to Salvador (Brazil). We left on time but staff was very rude and never took care of the requests of the passengers. I asked for headphones but they took 2 hours to arrive and half an hour for a glass of water. The entertainment system was not working properly and some movies never started playing. The speakers were really bad and we could barely hear the announcements. The seats are old and quite uncomfortable. Food was ok and we arrived on time.,9/12/2013,3,2,3,2,1,2
A Maric,0,London - Tivat in September 2009. Check in desk opened only 45 minutes before the flight - tickets stated that we had to be there 2 hours in advance. Business class seats comfortable but food served same as Economy Class : dry small roll with the tiniest piece of cheese and ham imaginable low quality orange juice served with it and a small pack of some kind of chocolate biscuit! The crew ate (quite loudly!) behind the small front curtain immediately before they started serving the meal to the passengers. During boarding we noticed that a young family was seated in business class - because it was not fully booked and they knew one of the FAs who upgraded them immediately. Co-pilot also sat in the first row and slept there stretching himself over three empty seats! We were truly stunned. Flight from Tivat was delayed for about 2 hours without any explanation. The security officer at the passport and luggage control was reading local newspaper - one could carry anything through - luckily no incidents. On the way back from Tivat same dreary food was offered which many refused. Early in the flight supply of water in the lavatory (the only one!) was lost completely and when asked about it one of the female crew shrugged without explanation. As a result everyone using the lavatory could not wash their hands. We were very disappointed with the whole experience on this return trip and would not recommend the airline unless there was an enormous emergency!,10/28/2009,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,2
Aba Meha,0,"I started off from Seattle to Ottawa. Flight was delayed by more than an hour in Seattle b/c of a ""technical problem."" Then I was stranded in Chicago for hours before I got to Ottawa after 2pm. I was supposed to get to Ottawa approximately at 9:30am. On my way back a week later I got to Ottawa airport at 4am for my 6am flight. We were told flight was canceled due to a ""technical problem"" and I was asked to come back at 2pm. I had to argue with them to get me the 11.45 flight to Chicago. Stated in Chicago for hours then arrived in Seattle close to 6pm. I was supposed to be back in Seattle approximately at 10.30am. To be fare they provided us two $8 (Canadian) food vouchers.

Alessio Falco,0,Milan Bergamo to Lviv via Timisoara. Flight due to leave at 11.30 a.m. check-in started 2.5 hours before departure. 20 mins after take off we were served lunch and the chance to have some wine. After 1h 50minutes we landed in Timisoara - after 1 hour we were boarded on the flight to Lviv the aircraft was another Saab 2000 the flight attendants were again smiling and professional but this time we were served only a snack with beverages. Lviv airport looks like a Museum a small Opera House inside a lot of Soviet Fresco paintings on the walls no bars but only a self service snack point - no boarding gate but a small departure area divided from the apron by a small door. Again the aircraft was a saab 2000 and the 2 flight attendants were helpful; this time we had hot breakfast - flight landed on time at Timisoara then after another hour we took off to Bergamo.,3/20/2008,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
Abbey Klugerman,0,"We flew from Ottawa to Hong Kong returned from Shanghai to Ottawa both via Vancouver. I paid extra for choice of preferred seats and while there was sufficient legroom the seats were so narrow as to make comfort and ultimately sleep impossible. The food was really nothing more than garbage with a choice of ""gruel"" or a slice of some sort of egg for breakfast. For dinner I chose the beef which was a very poor quality meat all fat and only 3 little pieces. I think next time I will pay more and try to fly with another carrier.",7/17/2014,3,1,1,4,2,5
A Garner,0,The flight was constantly delayed between islands. The last hop which is a 25 minute flight all 3 flights between Honolulu and Maui were delayed by 4 hours. The airlines never apologized for the delayed never explained why there was a delay and provided no compensation for the inconvenience. In addition they are selective on checking bags although ours fit in the box they made us check them. Because they were checked we could not switch to a different airline . I would pay the extra and fly Hawaiian airlines and be on time.,5/23/2013,1,3,0,0,4,NaN

Friendly and professional crew very comfortable seats plenty of leg room stylish pillows and blankets excellent selection of wine and drinks and delicious meal.

Abbott Peter,0,"I flew China Eastern's new YYZ to PVG direct service and multiple flights within Asia. I chose China Eastern because it saved me some money. I am a veteran traveler and to my recollection I have flown over 40 airlines in various locales around the world China Eastern is by far the worst airline it has ever been my misfortune to fly. The staff were incompetent. (At the airport I asked if I could upgrade. And after 3 attempts including trying to overcome the language barrier with the supervisor I gave up). The food was inedible. You know it is bad when you choose the pasta with seafood and the flight attendant asks ""Are you sure?"" and shows you the food before giving it to you). The seat was uncomfortable. (Old material not enough legroom). The in-flight entertainment was unviewable and had the worst English dub ever. If the website had allowed me to leave them no stars in any category I would have because they don't deserve any. No matter how much money you may save by flying this airline it is not worth it.",1/19/2015,1,1,1,1,1,1
A Gaskin,0,When we used to be able to fly through Chicago O'hare AA wasn't as bad. The last 12 times we've gone through DFW the plane sits on the runway after arrival for 30 minutes every time. This makes even an average time between connections tight. Then we get to our gate and the gate has changed while we're on the skytrain. And too often the flight is cancelled for no known reason. AA changes my seat unbeknown to me until check in which irks me. I do not care for the new 737s. All seats are 3+3 so there are no good rows and already tray tables are broken lights don't work and I don't think they fix them often. My husband is a 'top' platinum so he doesn't have some of the problems I do but he's not pleased anymore either.,4/8/2014,1,1,1,1,2,1
Alex Daskalakis,1,Travelling from NCE-ATH-NCE for the best part of 2 years very good service assistance and even accounting for delays on the NCE-ZRH route always managed to make the flights to Athens.

When I called customer services they went above and beyond to make sure all my questions were answered. Onboard flight attendants were helpful quick to respond the food was pretty good and the inflight entertainment had lots of current movies to choose from. Travelling on a transatlantic flight is miserable but Asiana made it as comfortable as possible. We missed our flight home from Phuket by 12 hours (it was my fault) and Asiana moved us to the next flight that evening for free. I recommend Asiana to anyone looking at a long distance flight.,12/3/2013,4,4,4,5,5,10
A Gautam,1,QR653 KTM-DOH 10 Nov. First time ever with QR the flight supervisor was attentive and friendly the food of good standard and proportion.

Abdul Halim Hamzah,1,Flight Subang to Penang on 20th April was on time and crew were friendly even though flight was full. The last flight I took before this departed early in the morning and it was a rush about 6-7 flights departing with around 5 mins gap. The airport needs to add more gates and improve signage to the aircraft. Firefly staff did the best they could and even managed a quick smile. The latest flight took place mid morning and it was not as hectic on departure as the early morning one. Departure from Penang was ok gate was far from the counters and one level down but the aircraft is right in front of the gate! If you are travelling ex-Penang don't go to the gate too early as there is absolutely nothing down there. Prices seem to be lower than before. I remember thinking that the fares were high when I flew them last year but the last few trips were around the $100 (ringgit not USD) mark which is OK.,4/23/2014,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
A Gautam,0,BKK-SIN TG401 11 Apr. I will follow up from my previous comments and say it almost seems that their service keeps deteriorating each time you fly with them. 11 days into the month of April and they still have March's inflight entertainment guide. The inflight crew along with the inflight manager were very cold and did not have the charmingly friendly smile. To end the terrible service run they forgot to serve me my meal as well and when brought to their notice was followed by the all too common sorry. If long transit times were not an issue for me I would have stopped flying Thai it is just not worth flying Business Class with them anymore.,4/18/2013,3,1,2,2,1,2
A Mark,1,Bellingham to Las Vegas - The MD80 was quite old but the cabin was clean and fine for a short flight. We had an aborted take off at Bellingham due to a faulty toilet. We stayed on the aircraft for an hour whilst they cleaned up the mess and took the lavatory out of service - lovely. At least we didn't have to change aircraft or get off the plane. We were on our way after an hour with no further delays or issue. The cabin crew were friendly and the pilots were very good at keeping everyone up to date with the delay and progress during the flight. I'd fly with Allegiant again although clearly they have reliability issues with their older aircraft which can cause unexpected delays but for the price I can't complain too much.,9/18/2014,5,5,4,0,5,7

A Genner,1,We flew from LHR - Singapore - Brisbane - Cairns then the same return journey. In general the service was good and we all enjoyed the food very much. There was a problem on the route from Singapore to Brisbane in that our seats were in the centre block and for some reason the crew kept missing us first we got no food (they ran out just as they got to us then started serving people around us but not us) and in spite of several attempts to get their attention they ignored us. Eventually my husband had to go down and ask them for food. The stewardess was very apologetic. I also noticed that when seatbelt checks were done on that flight they didn't actually look along our row. I witnessed a couple of people pressing the Call button and getting no response at least for quite a while. On the same flight the entertainment monitors were unreliable. Mine didn't have sound for a while and my son's just stopped working. The other legs of our journey were quite good and I was impressed that our luggage reached our final destination efficiently. I did find the legroom a bit cramped but that was more to do with the pillows and blankets. The main problem on the final leg of our return journey was a child a couple of rows behind us that just cried incessantly for almost 16 hours. Being a night flight we'd hoped to sleep most of the way but the whole section of the plane around the child was kept awake. There seemed to be no bassinets on our flight so no doubt the child had to try to get comfortable sitting on parents lap? The crew were no doubt also affected by the crying but what can anyone do in such a situation?,6/8/2014,4,3,5,4,4,7
Alex Guo,1,Flew their new B77W from SHA to PEK in F two weeks ago. Overall the experience was mixed. Pros - needless to say brand new airplane and facilities. Above average (based on my experience on Chinese carriers) crew. Meal was nicely presented. Large IFE screen with plenty of choices. Cons - my seat did not go flat. I don't know if it's a mechanical failure so I asked an attendant to help me. She wasn't able to recline it either. Maybe acceptable for this 2hrs flight but certainly unacceptable for long haul. Annoying ads before every IFE program but overall worth trying out.,10/22/2014,4,2,4,4,4,7
A Marks,1,Flew BRS - EFL on 29/05/2014 and return leg on 05/06/2014 on a 757-200. Positives first both flights on time and landed early cabin crew were polite and helpful and leg room was just about OK bearing in mind I'm 6ft 2in but for a 3.5 hour flight it was OK even with the window seat. The negative the plane was dirty on the inside and we were the first flight that plane had done one the way out no excuse really for Thomson apart from cutting corners with cleaning! Also the plane was very old now it works and got us there and back but was rather tatty in places and could do with a re-furb or replacement! Overall it was good like I said on time friendly staff just a bit dirty/grubby and old/tatty will use them again if the price is right!,6/13/2014,4,3,3,0,5,8
Abdulmohsen Alhashim,0,The way good airlines are distinguished from bad ones is how they deal with unexpected events. I missed my connection flight from Addis Ababa to Kuwait and that happens. But for them to make minimum effort to attend to passengers missing their connection flights and pay no attention to customer satisfaction is unacceptable. They offered me the most uncomfortable alternative itinerary the one that is most convenient and cheapest for them with no consideration to my inconvenience. Also had to pay from my own pocket to make the route easier. Addis Ababa airport staff are extremely rude and there is no escaping being subject to their rudeness since you have to ask around for your connection gate as there are no clear directions at the poorly facility that is their airport. I would rather pay extra for Emirates and guarantee a respectable treatment when things go wrong.,10/22/2013,1,2,2,1,2,NaN
A Gibbons,1,AKL to Apia return on NZ 992/991 for a four day trip travelling only with hand luggage. Web checked the first flight and went straight to lounge prior to boarding. Lounge busy but kept clear of passengers used dishes. Good selection of food available lounge attendants efficient as was the barista in making me a great macchiato! Flights themselves were generally excellent. Crew friendly and efficient both ways. Not much to say about return flight as leaves Apia at 0150hrs arriving 0500hrs but had a whole row to stretch out in to sleep. Early arrival home and outside terminal in 10 minutes after landing. Excellent value for money. Look forward to me next trip.,9/1/2014,5,5,0,5,5,10
Alex Hempel,1,Vienna to Rome in October 2013. Vienna has this amazing facility where if you fly Air Berlin or Austrian you can check your hold luggage in at the city train station up to a day before and take the express train out to the airport. We made use of this facility and despite being a bit doubtful everything worked perfectly. Thanks to this we had no waiting time at check-in or at the airport. Boarding was orderly and quick even with only one person at the gate. Flight crew was friendly the plane being a newish A320. Inflight snack was okay nothing special but I've seen worse airplane food. On arrival in Rome we had to wait over half an hour for our luggage but that seems to be par for the course there. All in all I'd fly them again.,10/22/2013,3,3,3,0,4,7
Abhishek Saxena,1,DEL-SVO SVO-KRR KRR-SVO and SVO-DEL. DEL-SVO was late by more than 6 hours and as per the airline rules we should have got a hotel stay. Instead we had to spend the whole 6.5 hours at the IGI T3. Supposed to board an A330-200 which was unfortunately unavailable so we boarded a A330-300 with wide and comfortable seats and on-board entertainment facility! An hour after take off came the drinks.

A Gibson,1,"Quick online check-in and boarding passes with the BA mobile APP. It is so easy to use and definitely helps you to get rid of those annoying loose bits of paper from your cabin bags. Manchester Airport Terminal 3 is bursting at the seams during the summer holiday mornings. There's a severe lack of seats in this terminal but despite this, the security check didn't take too long at all. The BA ground staff at Manchester seemed friendly enough and boarded strictly in groups from the back of the aircraft to the front. This helps stop the queuing in the aisles onboard to get to your seat. We were greeted at the aircraft door by a couple of cheerful and friendly crew. The refreshed cabin now looks very modern, welcoming and clean. The comfort of the new seats and the space on this aircraft (A321) I feel would be more than sufficient for a flight of 2-3 hours or so (I'm 5ft 11""). With a fully loaded cabin and a flight time to Heathrow of just over 30 minutes the crew were quick into action. We were offered a hot breakfast bacon wrap, orange juice and tea or coffee, perfect for such a short flight and definitely helps set BA apart from the competition.

Only 3 small Food areas which were packed so no seats available all power connections for laptops were occupied waited 30 minutes to get my food and had to eat it standing. The service on board (economy) is poor a scarce meal is served during the first 2 hours and then for 6 hours staff (not friendly) get to rest and only show up 1 hour before landing to serve a snack.

A Martin,0,Having flown Easyjet since 2005 I can certainly say they have gone downhill. What happened to that friendly fun cabin crew and low cost flights from friendly low cost airports? They have just become a boring and typical traditional airline a bit like a cheap BA. You now have to either reserve seats or hope that you get the seats you want when checking in further increasing the costs if you want to sit together in good seats. I much prefer the format of paying a bit extra for priority boarding and choosing to sit wherever you like. I found cabin crew to be too pushy to sell items as they kept waking people up with announcements every 20 minutes. I also found the range of food and drink on board to be small and were out of stock with most items by the time they were a third of the way down the cabin. They are also concentrating too much on Gatwick Airport and making reductions elsewhere. They stopped flying from East Midlands and have now cut back drastically at Stansted now they serve Southend which is disastrous for anybody living outside of Essex or East London. With now only having any decent service from London Bristol and the Liverpool/Manchester area in England I am finding them increasing unattractive to fly and am sticking more to Ryanair. I will not be looking to fly with them again any time soon if this trend continues!,6/10/2013,4,4,2,NaN,3,3
Alex Knisely,0,"LHR-PHL BA067 19th April. One of the features of a British Airways (BA) flight that attracted me in the past was the breadth of special-meal options. This until recently included a ""seafood meal"". Indeed ten years ago BA had fisherman's pie as an option in economy class not just the horrible and relentless chicken-or-pasta - then they boasted of their support for the British fishing industry - no longer. Seafood meals are gone. Why? From a BA response: ""I'd like to inform you that the meals have been removed due to the low volumes with many of our customers now choosing other options"". Indeed. If no seafood meal exists then there is no choice there are no options. There is only chicken-or-pasta. Really what would it take to offer a ""cold seafood meal"" a tuna-fish salad and a bread roll? One more reason to choose BA is gone. One more reason to fly with a Middle Eastern airline such as Etihad who still care about service of a sort that BA has started to abandon.",4/22/2015,2,1,1,3,4,5

The planes seemed old for such a trendy airline I would have expected more modern and up to date facilities. The in flight entertainment uses a wired controller which was very worn and awkward to get to. I felt like washing my hands every time I touched it.,7/17/2014,2,2,2,2,4,4
Acres Gerry,1,Flew Etihad from Abu Dhabi to London on B777-300. Ground handling very good and cabin service excellent with nice mix of nationalities among cabin crew. However very disappointed with economy class seating. Seat was narrow hard and very uncomfortable. Good sized toilets though (BA please note).,1/14/2015,3,2,4,4,5,7
A Gillespie,1,"Flew MEL-AUH-DUB. Booked business and got unexpectedly upgraded to First Class for MEL-AUH leg. Luxurious. Private cabin. Flight attendants were excellent. Wine and Champagne delicious. Lamb shanks were cooked to perfection. First Class flat bed is wide and long and allows for a great sleep / comfortable flight. AUH-DUB trip was business class. The business class flat bed is not long enough for people over 6"". I recommend a window seat for tall people - there is 'extra' space for your legs / feet between seat and side of plane.",12/12/2013,4,4,4,4,5,9
A Martin,1,Before flying with Spirit my family and I felt a little anxious. We didn't know anything about this airline so we took a chance and the experience was nice. Excellent staff at the airports. Spirit is a Low Cost Airline do not expect great service onboard. The itinerary was on time including layover at Fort Lauderdale. If someone is looking for save some money although you must pay for luggage snacks seat location etc this airline is a good choice. But if people want special service on board first class free luggage or seat location this is not your best bet. The most important must be the air safety excellent maintenance and well trained crews and if this airline does it I have no complaints. After all everybody wants to arrive on time to your destination.,4/27/2014,5,3,2,1,5,10
Alex Lockwood,1,Kigali-Johannesburg. We were 45 mins late departing Kigali with no explanation but arrived in Jo'burg at the scheduled time. Clean aircraft very smooth flight professional and very friendly crew Rwandan 'Primus' beer served on board with a tasty meal. Like most African continental airlines expensive compared to what we are used to in Europe but otherwise very good. Recommended for convenient and safe travel throughout the region.,7/12/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,7
Adam Bass,0,"Experience was poor. We booked with Ryanair after a long time of not using them after previous bad experiences but saw the new website and various other newly replaced items and services that Ryanair use and bought tickets for return flights to Tenerife. However easier the prepayment section of the booking experience and website may be we found that once you had played the airline used all sorts of dirty tricks such as making you pay for allocated seating if you wanted to make sure your party was sitting together and charging for all sorts of other service that would be expected to be provided freely. This made the flights no cheaper than the ones that other airlines offered. The cabin - despite pictures on the internet - looked gloomy, old fashioned and dirty. Onboard food as overpriced and service was slow. The cabin crew were constantly pushing you to buy products as they are partially payed on commission. Also the main reason Ryanair is usually on time is that unlike other airlines they add an additional 10 minutes onto the actual estimated flight time.",6/29/2015,2,2,1,NaN,1,2
A Gipson,0,"I arrive at the airport 2 hours ahead of time to find the Frontier line out of the door. There were two extremely slow agents and a slew of broken kiosks. After an hour in line I finally got through security to find out my flight was delayed. Because of this I would miss my connecting flight. Frontier rebooked me on one of their later itineraries - one that would get in 3 hours 17 minutes later than my original itinerary. Even though there was other flights available on other carriers I was booked on this flight. After doing some research on Frontiers website I found Frontier's policy about controllable flights. ""If we can't get you on a Frontier flight scheduled to arrive within three hours of your original itinerary we'll do our best to arrange for you to fly on another available carrier or combination of carriers with whom we have agreements."" After bringing this to the attention of the agent at the gate I was booked on another connecting flight on another airline. Then I found out our original flight was cancelled so I would miss my new connecting flight. While standing in line at the gate trying to rebook my flight I was told I had to go back to the ticketing counter to do so. I had been standing in this line for 45 minutes already. I proceeded back through security and waited in another line for an hour and a half line to try to rebook to get on a new flight. I cannot believe an airline could be so incompetent. I feel that it is ridiculous that I have to go on Frontier's website and show it to Frontier agents in order for anything to happen.",8/16/2012,1,2,2,0,1,1
A Masum,1,LHR-ZYL. ZYL-DAC-LHR. Flying with Biman for the first time was a great experience. Outbound flight LHR-ZYL departed 10 mins early. Aircraft was Biman's 3rd new Boeing 777 300ER (S2 AHM / Akash Prodeep) which was only 1 month old and was completely fresh inside out. Colour of the seats was a bit dreary but was comfortable with plenty of legroom. Staff were nice and friendly but a some of them need to smile a bit more. Food was excellent. Inbound flight from ZYL to DAC was delayed by 2 hours. Plane was in good nick which was Bimans first B777 (Palki). DAC-LHR was Bimans 2nd Boeing (Arun Alo) which was also pretty much clean until a few hours in to the flight were the toilets became a mess. I would definitely fly with Biman again when I travel to Bangladesh as it only takes 9.5 hours rather than 15 hrs should I have used another airline which requires changing aircraft's.,4/9/2014,5,5,5,3,5,10
Alex Page,1,Only a short flight from Birmingham UK to Amsterdam. Slept most of the way but woke up to a free sandwich which I didn't expect on such a short flight. Would recommend this airline. Flight was KL1420. Plane had a modern feel to it.,10/8/2014,5,4,4,4,5,8
Adam Debrincat,1,This is the 1st time we have ever flown with EasyJet and they do a great job. We flew 4 times with them from Paris-Rome 21/12/13 then Rome-Nice 28/12/13 then Nice-Barcelona 2/01/14 and Barcelona-Paris 7/01/14. We only had 1 small delay and on all other flights left on time. Would recommend.,1/8/2014,5,5,0,NaN,5,8
Alex Ross,0,I try to avoid flying United when I can but as I was with Continental I sort of inherited their frequent flyer program. So my review is of a recent flight this last summer but also of their frequent flyer plan which unless you are a Business flyer I would avoid. It's almost impossible to move up to Gold with them. I flew 50K miles flew on them 4 times but failed to spend 5000 dollars on their tickets because I live overseas and usually fly Turkish and claim the miles because I thought they were in the same alliance which it turns out isn't really true - at least not for United. The flight we took was from London to Houston. Cancelled because it's United and we were placed on a flight to NYC in an effort to get us to a flight that connected to Texas which we missed so then they put us on a flight to Chicago so that they wouldn't have to pay for a Hotel etc ad nauseam. Funnily enough our flight back to London from Texas had one leg cancelled because it's United and they told us to drive from Austin to Houston but that's another story altogether. The plane we were on from London to NYC was just about clean enough my gluten free meal was gone because it's United (My flight had been cancelled and my meal with it) and the entertainment system was down because it's United. Needless to say I am now with the FF program of Turkish Airlines and will never fly United again unless it's impossible due to US monopolistic practices. Don't fly United.,1/26/2015,1,1,1,1,2,1
A Goddard,0,London - Miami Return January 2015 (Boeing 777). I could only choose where I wanted to sit 24 hrs before my flight which was fine as most airlines have that policy but what really threw me back was that all aisle and window seats cost an extra $69 - $100 each way depending where the seat was located! You have to pay extra for an aisle seat at the back of the plane on a 10hr transatlantic flight? This is not easyjet or Ryanair for goodness sake! The so called cheap flight on a major airline was not so cheap after all as they were already nickel and diming before getting off the ground. I refused to pay and went for a free middle seat which I loath I have wide shoulders and have to hunch inwards my plan was to arrive early and hope the check-in desk could sort me out with an aisle seat which they were able to do but that is where the Customer satisfaction stopped.) Plane was on time and boarding was reasonably quick and I was perched in my aisle seat which was very narrow I also noticed many people getting their roller cases stuck in the aisles as they tried to roll them down but it turns out that in an effort to squeeze an extra seat in each row American Airlines compromised with narrower seats and aisles. In the air nightmare #1 The narrow aisle caused one particular cabin crew to bump the trolley into my shoulder or elbow without even so much as an apology. #2 You get free beer and wine but the entire cabin ran out beer and white wine before the first drinks trolley finished its first pass. #3 The plane was old and the only movies available played at set times (not on demand) that's right 2015 with 90s technology - AA may have painted their planes but they are still old and nasty inside. Worst of all it was the same experience on the return leg mercifully the flight was 60 mins less - A truly awful transatlantic flight!,3/17/2015,1,1,1,2,2,2
Adam Field,1,We just finished flying LAX-Zurich-Rome and Venice-Zurich-LA on the way back). Several of those legs were delayed but only by a few minutes each and they were honestly apologetic about even that much so I'm not complaining. All the cabin staff was friendly and helpful. Food was decent by ground standards but mind blowingly good by economy seat on a plane standards compared to other airlines I've flown. We got a full meal and a sandwich going one way and a meal a sandwich and ice cream going the other way - all several steps above edible. Free booze on the longer legs too! (Various little bottles of spirits plus the house red/white wines. Wines merely drinkable spirits were fairly classy considering we were in coach and they were free. If you want Campari though I learned you have to grab it quickly as they always ran out. Checking in our bags at LAX was the most painless experience I've had checking in. Zurich airport by contrast is surprisingly a bit of a madhouse but while the lines there were long once we figured out which line to stand in it also moved remarkably quickly so we weren't in line for too long. I would definitely fly with SWISS again unless one of the other small handful of respectable airlines were way cheaper. That said not everything was perfect: their website was having issues all the time (we had to call to get our confirmation numbers and to reserve seats because their web reservation system was all kinds of buggy). Our seats on the transatlantic flights were quite cramped (I'm extremely thankful we got seats that were only 2 across or the flight would have been hell. It was still a bit cramped even just me and my wife.) The transatlantic flights also didn't have individual seat-controllable air and as a result got rather stuffy one of the flights.,5/23/2014,4,2,5,5,5,8
A Matthews,1,LHR-KTM via BAH. Good flight on all legs. Good food. Cabin staff efficient and professional. Unlimited drinks on request. Poor quality headphones meant unable to use inflight entertainment but not really that important to me. Food was good.,12/23/2011,4,4,4,3,4,8
Alex Sheyni,0,Flew from Istanbul to Tehran very recently old and dirty airplane very unhelpful cabin crew. Return from Tehran to Istanbul was a nightmare as I had to wait 1.45 hrs to check in due to a lack of staff at the airport. I will not recommend the airline at any price.,4/24/2014,1,1,2,1,1,1
Adam Jel,1,"Overall rating of 7/10. The Lufthansa Business class lounge at Frankfurt is very nice. Great food and ground service. Business class seats are extremely comfortable, spacious and soft, but it costs a lot more than traveling Business class on Air France. The staff is polite. Great experience! Would recommend Lufthansa!",6/21/2015,1,5,4,3,3,7
Alex Stare,0,Flew march 12/14 on JP from ZRH-LJU-ZRH. The flights were on time the flight attendants nice and helpful. The sandwich has got an upgrade and is now equal to LH. A Minus point was that they were handing out only Apple Juices - if you wanted to have wine or other drinks you had to ask specifically for it. This gives me kind of a cheap impression as it seems to the passenger that they wanted to hide it from them. The wine they served was below industry standards and not what a wine country like Slovenia should serve its guests on their trip to the country. I absolutely agree that on such short legs there is no necessity of any food/drinks however either this is clearly defined in the service guide of the airline or then crews should adhere to their service guidelines.,3/18/2004,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Maynard,0,PVG-XIY-PVG. Good fare on the outbound leg had to pay 3 times the price for the return due to Chinese holidays. Both flights were A320 and looked rather tired & dated inside. Seat belt signs remain on at all times and the flight deck make no comments. Cabin crew efficient - but not over friendly. Reasonable free food and soft drinks. Return delayed 90 minutes with little information & last minute gate change. Luggage arrived before I did as it was placed on an earlier flight (?),10/16/2011,3,3,4,3,3,6
A Goei,0,Kuwait to Mumbai on 28 September 2014. Only 2 toilets available for all economy passengers toilets soon dirty not cleaned. Uncomfortable seats. As soon as plane landed in Mumbai and still moving fast seat belts were opened and passengers started pulling bags out of the overhead lockers. Staff's reaction was late and not effective. Then pulling shoving and pushing to get out of airplane first window seat passengers elbowing their way past aisle seat passengers chaos reigned. Never again Jet Airways!,10/20/2014,2,1,2,2,2,1
Adam McLane,1,JFK-JNB return. This was my first long haul flight and first trip to Africa. (Many transatlantic flights though) I found everything about the trip to be professional and meeting my expectations. The seats reclined sufficiently for the level of service. Food and food options were good. Lots of snacks good portion sizes etc. The wine was decent and did the trick. The in-flight entertainment really helped pass the time. I watched more TV and movies on those two flights than I've watched in months. I was pleasantly surprised by the friendliness of the flight attendants. The return flight was only about 40% full so I was able to fully lay down and sleep 10+ hours straight. An overall great experience I'd fly with them again.,5/19/2013,4,3,4,4,5,9
Alex Tan,1,I bought round-trip tickets from Singapore to Bangkok for $265 which was a really great bargain. TG 404. 9th December. The aircraft model that operated this flight was a Boeing 777-300ER and the seats were pretty comfortable for a 2 hour long flight. Pillows were found on every seat. The entertainment system was responsive and the food was excellent. The taste was great and they came in pretty big portions. I was full before I even got to the dessert. It's a pity no menu was given out though. The cabin crew were a little rushed but generally pretty friendly. TG413. 13th December. I was lucky enough to grab a seat on the Airbus 340-600 which is such a gorgeous plane and one of Thai's most coveted aircraft models by aviation enthusiasts. The seats were definitely not as comfortable as the ones found on the Boeing 777-300ER but good enough for a 2 hour flight. The entertainment system wasn't as responsive and was reset a few times which was annoying to say the least. All in all Thai Airways IMHO is a really strong competitor with Singapore Airlines on the Singapore to Bangkok route and I would fly with them again.,12/22/2014,5,4,5,4,4,10
A Maynard,0,MAN-MUC in May B777-300ER economy class. Check in and cabin crew very friendly. Punctual. B777 interior a little dated and probably due for a refurbishment. Food basic but as you would expect on a short leg. Nothing exceptional that would distinguish from flying another airline. I had a small ground services issue that the airline was unwilling to resolve on that basis I could not recommend.,6/7/2015,3,3,3,3,3,3
A Goldberg,0,"I booked travel from Prague to Paris. The flight was ""on time"" when I checked in but then quickly became 2 hours late and actually left 2.5 hours late. No Smartwings personnel at the gate until about 30 minutes prior to departure and there were limited announcements. If you have been travelling internationally the Smartwings baggage allowances are less 15 kilos rather than 20 and a 30 Euro fee awaits those with baggage over the 15 kilo limit. At least the fare was inexpensive.",6/6/2012,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,5
Adam Mueller,0,My wife and I recently traveled for business out of 4 flights 2 of the departing flights were late the second causing us to miss our connecting flight that left early. The flight was scheduled for 12.05 and we were standing at the gate at 12.03 the plane was already gone after we rushed off the plane and across Atlanta airport because this being a Delta hub they can't have planes in the same concourse. We go to the counter and are told they moved us to a different flight without telling us because we weren't going to make our original flight. So they are delaying us 2 hours because they couldn't leave on time for a 8.25 first flight. I politely asked if we could wait in the Delta sky club and was rudely told that it costs 50.00 to use the sky club. I will make sure I will not fly Delta again.,10/7/2013,2,1,1,1,1,1
Alexa Barry,0,After taking a red-eye from San Francisco I was bumped from my flight. It happens the planes were switched but the very blatant tension selection of those who got left behind was very frustrating. The customers left behind had booked their flight well in advance and there seemed to be a consistent trait we were connectors from SF. The question of whether I was in for an adventure aka a delayed flight to a completely different location was condescending. No apology until I dealt with a woman at the end of the process. She treated the situation with sensitivity and realized that as a traveler and customer this could possibly be stressful and frustrating. As their customer it seemed like my Sunday was worth less than everyone on the plane. Perhaps they should under board planes not over board them to make more money.,8/8/2014,1,2,1,1,2,1
A Maza,0,We were traveling to San Luis Potosi from Phoenix. Check in took 1.5 hours we got 5 seats two or 3 rows separated from each other (3 kids 47 and 10). We relied on the kindness of people on the plane to get all the seats together. For delays we lost the connection flight to SLP in Mexico City and we got a flight next day (18 hours later from our original). I asked for compensation for the hotel expenses We got nothing but the worst is that at the next day We just find out that local passengers got hotel expenses and we were international. I am going to use this airline.,6/8/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,2
A Gomez,1,CCS-PMV-GND (B732 and ATR42) Good service at the airport and on-board with Conviasa. Check-in staff could use some cheering up pleasantly surprised when offered a snack box on the PMV-GND flight flight attendants well dressed and good looking but was a little disappointed with the condition of the aircraft interior on the PMV-GND flight. I would be glad to fly on Conviasa again on the future.,9/3/2009,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
Adam Muller,0,VIE-AMS one way bought just few days before departure so quite expensive. Long bus ride from terminal 3 to somewhere in the middle of Vienna airport to board an old Fokker 100. I don't mind flying unusual types of aircraft's but given the engine configuration of Fokker (rear mounted engine) and the fact that I was seated in the 3rd from the back means it was extremely noisy thorough the entire flight. What bothered me the most was that the seats do not have any moveable headrests. Seat pitch poor but unfortunately that is typical to all intra-Europe economy today. Inedible snack and one round of drinks offered during the flight.,2/25/2014,1,2,2,1,3,4
Alexander Capousis,1,CNX-MFM. Kiosk check-in with no bags. Took all of 10 seconds. Flight landed on-time in Macau. Flight left on-time but waited on the tarmac for 20 minutes before take-off with no explanation as to why. Cabin staff friendly and helpful. Would happily fly them again especially ex-CNX!,2/6/2015,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
Adam Simmons,1,LHR-DEL-SYD. In both cases the plane was very lightly loaded in both business and economy cabins. Seats in B777 (LHR-DEL) and B787 (DEL-SYD) were lie flat and not too difficult to manoeuvre after a little experimentation. IFE: B777 has less choice for western tastes and the remote control was very fiddly in the end I gave up. B787 had touch screen which was much easier to use and more responsive. Service overall was very good except for one older female attendant on LHR-DEL who appeared to speak barely any English and could learn to crack a smile from time to time.,4/21/2014,5,5,4,3,4,8
A Gori,1,NBO-JNB-NBO in Economy Class B737-800 both ways. Both flights on time with friendly and efficient service from the cabin crew. I had pre-ordered a low-carbohydrate meal. Out of Nairobi this request was carried out. On the return flight again I received a tray with cake and crackers and the main course was a serving of white rice and beans. The cabin attendant seemed to have absolutely no idea what the problem was. IFE consisted of the same movie on both flights even though the inflight magazine advertised different movies into and out of Johannesburg on the 737.,3/19/2012,4,4,3,2,3,7
A McCaffrey,0,Travelled as a couple from London Gatwick to Rome (Fiumicino airport) from Gatwick on Sunday 31st May 2015 and returned to London Gatwick from same airport on Thursday 4th June 2015. Outbound flight: delayed by 1.5 hours due to original Airbus A320 (180 seats) out of action due to technical issues (Easyjet excuse) so eventually transferred to Airbus A319 (only 156 seats). Tight squeeze and confusion for many of where to sit and many family members split. This plane was looking it's age inside and rattled a lot. It was one of the spare ones used specifically for breakdowns. Inbound flight: Delayed by 2 hours. Okay this airport has had a fire but please it was a month ago! Tannoy systems should be fixed by now. This may not be Easyjets fault but consider this: The flight was EZY5260. There was nothing on the electronic screens to show that this flight even existed (despite an Easyjet representative saying that the flight was erased it was never on the boards as we were at the airport for many hours). At the departure terminal 2 there was no information but after several enquiries to airport staff we were asked to go to terminal 3. No information and nobody to consult. There was even a young Easyjet employee who was travelling on an earlier flight (there were several to the UK all delayed) who was as perplexed as we were). At last after further enquiries and looking at the Easyjet website on phones the reason given for the delay was that a technical fault was the excuse. Easyjet are not at fault on the airport issues but I think they could do a lot better. Replacing ageing aircraft is a must and leaving passengers in the dark is inexcusable. Even though the pilot apologized for the delay it's not the delay at all it's the lack of common sense and dialogue that exasperates passengers. I've been in similar positions with other airlines. What do they do? Obtain a large white card describe the problem and where to go and have a rep at the terminal as described. It's not rocket science is it? The marks given are for poor customer relations and not the flight or pilot or flight attendants who were probably as cheesed off as the passengers for working later than anticipated.,6/6/2015,3,2,3,NaN,5,3
Alexander Ford,0,Smooth way through the airport of Madrid. Check-in done online. The best way to do it nowadays. Even though Air Nostrum operates from the K area in Madrid this flight was boarded by bus which is ok. Very positive is the fact that you can deliver your hand-luggage next to the aircraft and thus not check it in or wait for it at a luggage belt. The stewardess was very friendly and well groomed. In general the cabin crews of Air Nostrum are young and good looking. The old CRJ200 was noisy and small not my favourite regional aircraft. The flight was short and uneventful. The inflight service consisted of 'tu menu' which is in your seat pocket and from which you can buy 'Iberia' style snacks and drinks. Not too long ago this carrier still offered free of charge beverages and even snacks and sandwiches.,8/12/2013,2,2,0,0,3,4
A Gray,0,AKL-SIN 777 200 plane was old but seats were comfortable. The service was average food was terrible choices poor. The entertainment system was old screen scratched and selection average. I have flown a lot on SQ over the years but recently tried EK who are far superior. SQ have lost their edge their product is old. I would choose EK or NZ if I had a choice in future.,7/7/2013,1,3,1,1,3,2
Alexander Hart,1,For a low-cost airline I was naturally not expecting very much at all; however I was pleasantly surprised. For a slightly higher fee I could get significantly more legroom (more than that on British Airways) seat preference choice (unlike most budget airlines) and food. The collective deal was well worth the price. I would recommend this airline.,8/5/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,10
Adam Stolarczyk,1,"Flew CDG-ICN-CEB and CEB-ICN-PRG in economy. A380 was fabulous with excellent seat pitch (34) duty free shop at the rear and wide comfortable cabin. Others a/cs like B747-400 and 777-200 older but well maintained however on route ICN-PRG they used older 777 with old economy seats and smaller legroom. Crew attentive ready to help or to serve additional drinks or snacks. Food very good and bibimbap (Korean dish) very tasty. During the night noodles also available in the galleys. For one leg I ordered special ""seafood"" meal which again was perfect and consists fish shrimps and even scallops. In general - perfect legroom (in A/C with new economy seats) nice crew and perfect meals.",2/19/2013,3,5,5,4,4,10
A Greenhill,0,"Connecting flight to Melbourne was initially delayed by 5 hours and then a group of us were bumped from the flight to accommodate for other delayed flights and people who had missed their Sydney flight. Terribly handled by the crew, no communication or information given. Very minor compensation given, with minimal information. This is on the back of them losing my bag for three days last year and not taking responsibility, since the last connection was with their partner airline, air Berlin. ",7/16/2015,1,2,2,2,1,3
A McCormick,0,"I was flying from Dublin to JFK NY on July 30 flight 291. I got the impression that serving the needs of the passengers was not a priority. I had reported to a flight attendant about some good amount of water sloshing around in the lavatory. It was slippery and the dirty liquid had got on my shoes and clothing. The flight attendant replied that she did not think the liquid was water and was not going to touch it. I do not understand why it could not have been mopped up. I think is was very inappropriate of the Airline to not train their flight attendants in mopping up unpleasant ""spills"" in the lavatories and providing them the sanitary means of doing so. This was upsetting to me to have to use lavatories with unsanitary conditions on an airline! The American Airline website makes it very difficult to send a complaint to. I think this is very important for them to see this and to correct it. I gave the airline poor ratings and do not plan to fly it again.",8/18/2014,1,1,3,1,1,1
Alexander Kraev,1,ZRH-SOF with a brand new Embraer E190. Quick boarding and flight was on time. Cabin crew was friendly.

A Griggs,1,Flew PEK-KUL. Flight left Beijing with just a minor delay due to a late arrival. The cabin crew were very friendly and before take off confirmed our meal request and informed us that we would be woken 1 hour before arrival for breakfast. The lie flat beds were ideal for the overnight flight especially as the economy section appeared to be 100% full. The pillow and blanket provided were especially soft which helped get a full 6 hour sleep. For the extra cost I would fully recommend AirAsia X Premium.,7/24/2013,5,5,4,3,5,9

Alexander Lindley,0,Frankfurt to Vienna and was quite satisfied. I was surprised when the flight attendant started giving out meals as I did not expect to be fed at all on such a short flight of only 55 minutes.

A McFadden,1,DUB-BHX-DUB. Early morning flight to Birmingham using the new T2 fantastic building and a great service from EI ground crew. Outbound crew good but not anywhere near the Aer Lingus standard. Onboard service was standard on UK bound services. Return flight that night a disgrace.

A Griggs,1,LHR-LIS-FAO return. All flights left about 10-30 minutes late yet the time was always made up in flight. Seats are quite comfortable and I would recommend row 24 on A321 as it is exit seat with extra room. Food served is average usually a cold sandwich apart for on LIS-LHR where due to a crew shortage no food or drinks could be served throughout the flight. TAP is a good option against the LCC when going to Europe as they offer competitive rates and include all meals and baggage. It must be said that their Lisbon hub is not the best due to the lack of signs and long walks between gates when transferring.,8/23/2012,3,4,2,2,3,6
A McLean,1,LAX-SCL Business new 767 on one leg and refurbished 767 on another. On time good food service comfortable seats. The only drawback is the side pairs of seats. The window passenger cannot get out unless they disturb the aisle. One of the two middle seats in the best choice.,12/14/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,4
Alexander Mokretsov,1,DME-HKG-DME. Fully satisfied with the flight. Check-in was very efficient staff very professional and polite. No delays both flights arrived actually 15 minutes earlier. Well-balance food on board. Excellent entertainment system with vast selection of movies & music. Great in-flight magazine with lots of useful tips on Hong Kong and interesting articles about other countries. The seats are a little bit funny but when you get used to them they are pretty comfortable indeed. Great value for money and comfort.,1/9/2014,5,4,4,5,5,10
Adam Woods,1,I flew Alitalia 4 times in the past 4 days. First flight was from Tirana International Airport to Rome Fiumicino on Sep 19th. Flight took off and landed on time so I guess this flight was pleasant on an A320. There was a choice of salty/sweet biscuits and a drink Pepsi/Water/Bravo and wine! Then I flew from Rome Fiumicino to London City Airport. I was travelling with my family and upon reaching our gate at Rome Airport we decided to check in towards the end because of the large lines of people waiting. For no reason whatsoever no bus came to pick us up for the next 30 minutes. Flew an Embraer plane to London which was rather odd considering the duration of the flight. I then flew yesterday Sep 22nd 2013 and the flights had similar problems. London-Rome took off at least 30 minutes late because of a busy runaway. Plane was an A320 once again and the flight was uneventful. Then from Fiumicino I flew to Tirana again on an Airbus A320! Flight to Tirana took off 1 hour late! In general I would fly Alitalia again.,9/24/2013,3,3,2,1,3,6
A Guerin,1,LHR-MCT-BKK return great value for money paid â‚¬540 pp return. Flights on time  good flight entertainment. Crew efficient and friendly adequate amount of drink and food services. Would fly with Oman Air again.,3/15/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
A McNicol,1,KUL to SYD in Premium. Booked economy and paid for an upgrade on Optiontown. All up cost a little over $A300 for a business class seat on an 8 hour flight. Wow - what else can I say? I am a 25 year member of an established carriers lounge and frequent flyer programme and after this I really wonder why? The seat is the equivalent of most flat bed international business class seats the plane clean and new and the staff amazing! Yes you pay for food and drink after one meal plus water but even this is reasonably priced. This flight was a real eye opener for me and Air Asia X will get repeat business after this.,8/27/2013,5,5,5,0,5,10
Alexander Mokretsov,1,Had a very good flight from Marrakech to Amsterdam with Transavia. The flight was on time very good plane. Flight attendants were very helpful and nice. The leg space was quite decent and the seats comfortable.,4/6/2014,5,4,0,0,5,9
A Gunn,1,My family of 3 flew economy class SEA-KEF-AMS. Inflight entertainment was good for adults. It might be best for the longer flights to bring extra movies for children as there wasn't too much for them besides two movies and a bunch of episodes of Lazytown. Seating was a bit crammed but get what you pay for. The nicest part was the effort on the part of the airline to keep us all seated together without trying to gouge us or blow us off like other airlines. Customer service appears to still have a pulse with Icelandair. There was only a slight delay with one of the four flights but we still managed to leave on time. We read about the food for pay thing ahead of time and packed our own meals. Our child's airline provided meal was brought hot and early in the flight and she was happy with it. Overall though I am satisfied with this airline and would fly again.,10/20/2013,4,3,0,5,5,9
Adeline Phillips,0,SATA have just reduced their two weekly flights from London to PDL to one per week from June 2009 and will not be offering Winter 2009/10 flights. The situation occurred due to the excessive flight prices on average Â£280-Â£350 return and is so uncompetitive that flights are running half empty. You can fly to Asia or Canada for the same price. The service on board SATA I found to be very good and quite relaxed but not reflective of the price. With a bit of foresight and good marketing this could be a very successful route. There is currently no other competition except for a code share with TAP which offers the same expensive fare. What a great shame for everyone especially the islands which are beautiful but trapped with only one uncompetitive airline living in a bygone era of state control.,5/31/2009,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,4
Alexander Rosario,0,Flight 7002 scheduled Dec 29 2013 at 9.30pm left January 1st 2014 at 9am. Flight 7001 left at 6pm on Jan 10th 2014. I understand how one can have a pleasant experience on the Dreamliner but that's not a credit to Norwegian that's a credit to Boeing. Unfortunately that is not always the case and since they are new planes they've had more than a few problems which one could consider as an opportunity for Norwegian to show some grace. They're not allied with any other airline so really hope they're on time and you don't have connecting flights with other airlines. They won't offer you any help. Their customer service is the worst if your flight is delayed or cancelled. You get the same smiling people who pretend to sympathize with you but that's it. Don't expect any compensation or help. My flight was delayed almost 3 days. I missed my connecting flight with another airline as a result. At the departure airport JFK in NYC they told me that they would put me on the next available Norwegian flight to my destination when I arrived in Oslo. When I got to Oslo they said I would have to buy another ticket because I was then traveling with another airline. This is despite the fact they were the reason I missed my flight. Also they don't offer water on the planes on long hauls.,2/12/2014,3,5,1,4,3,NaN
A McNicol,1,What a lovely way to fly compared to Jetstar. I have business in Northern NSW with a choice of Jetstar to Ballina or Qantas Link to Coffs Harbour. Give me Qantas Link every time - more room - a decent snack - a drink in the afternoon - friendly service and far more chance of being on time! Good value for money into Coffs as there is competition from Virgin.,5/14/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,10
A Gurevich,1,9 April 2015 BA 777 Business Class Seattle USA - Heathrow. Check-in easy lounge good boarding pleasant. Food quality was good not excellent but the film choice was great. Flat bed seats were comfortable enough. The breakfast was a little skimpy. The major downside was that for the money you pay for business class you should not have to pay to choose a seat at booking. BA will let you choose seats 7 days in advance if you are a mileage plan 1st elevated tier or better member but if not then you have to wait until 24 hours ahead. Of course you can always fork over another $113 to pre-reserve a seat. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you.,4/17/2015,3,3,3,5,3,7
Adhith Shanmugasundaram,1,"It was my first time on Emirates Business Class and the experience was really good. The cabin crew were quite friendly and made me feel comfortable. The seat was good with numerous features and was surprised to see the big collection of movies.

A Medeiros,0,I flew through Lisbon to S. Miguel. The flight from Lisbon was delayed for hours with no reasonable explanation given. However the most disturbing thing was the attitude of the SATA staff in Lisbon - the most unprofessional personnel I've come across. It was like they were doing passengers a favor by answering our questions and doing their jobs. If they dislike customers and customer service so much they should find another job. Wish there was another airline flying to the Azores. SATA is unjustifiably expensive but in order to avoid these guys I'd be willing to pay a little extra.,9/17/2010,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,2

A Mellows,1,ALA-BKK on 13th February 2013 returning on 17th February 2013. Offered a business class upgrade on boarding. The flat bed seats were brilliant for an overnight flight as was the meal drinks selection and level of customer service. A relaxing journey which went quickly due to the level of comfort and service. On the return journey I was in the economy seat I had originally purchased. I slept almost all the way and with my seat fully reclined I was able to stretch my legs out fully. There was certainly more legroom available than on other airlines I have flown into and out of Almaty and Kazakhstan itself. The meal was a lovely Thai chicken curry. The service was great and the drinks trolley was always in service.,2/20/2013,5,5,5,5,5,10
A Gutierrez,0,New York JFK to Bogota Colombia connecting through Mexico City. Aeromexico sold us 3 round trip tickets with one of the connections being operated by another airline (Avianca). I was traveling with my 2 small kids ages 5 and 6. At departure in JFK their system failed printing only 1 boarding pass for the connection MEX-BOG. Asked to go to the local Aeromexico ticket counter in Mexico City to pick up the missing boarding passes with the promise someone was going to have them ready. Forced to leave the connecting area at 5am (after a 5 hour flight) dragging my 2 small kids and luggage. In Mexico City at the Aeromexico ticket counter we were met by a supervisor who refused to print the missing boarding passes claiming my problem was with the second airline. I spent 45 minutes trying to find the other airline. They did not honor any of the seats booked together when the tickets were bought and separated my kids from me on one of the flights. Unfortunately they own a monopoly in Mexico.,5/23/2013,1,3,3,3,1,NaN
Alexander White,0,"Flew on new Dreamliner VS7, 4 July, premium economy and considering the cost felt Virgin were mean with food - cheap and not very cheerful. Ran out of ice half way through trip (I'm sure they had some at the front of the plane but miserable faced stewardess made no effort to find out). Two stewards at the start of flight brilliant. Far too expensive for what you get over economy.",7/15/2015,1,3,1,3,3,6
Adil Berdai,1,I have flown with Royal Air Maroc many times it's a very good airline and it has a reputation I can't seem to find when I'm on-board their aircrafts. Staff are very good and great with customer service. I was flying from London-Tangier and one man decided to smoke in the toilets the staff took this as a serious problem and treated him fairly and when we landed in Tangier he was arrested it's good to see action taken. They served lunch which I always love I had the chicken with rice and potatoes very tasty. Royal Air Maroc is a standard airline with great seats and very friendly staff their English is superb so no communication problems will occur on-board. It was very clean I called a member of staff 6 times during the 3 hr flight she was very happy serving me all the time.,7/5/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,10
Alexandr Baikalov,0,I used to regularly fly Air Moldova and could see a huge improvement for the last years. The service on flights to Western Europe was always rather very good. Even if in the beginning nothing was different from a regular Aeroflot plane commodities (Tupolev 134) the air hostesses were very attentive and tried their best (speaking English as well as Russian and Romanian). Recently they got Airbus 320 and the flight is a real pleasure. Air Moldova has added lately their entertainment TV program in flight. That is also a change to the horrible comedy Russian shows they used to air before.,10/1/2005,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Menon,1,Flew Lusaka-Addis Dubai on December 12th and return on Jan 4th. While going was expecting a Dreamliner on both sectors but was disappointed they were 77L's. Was impressed though with the 77L's new aircraft lots of leg room had PTV's but feel that there should be more variety in the in-flight entertainment. Nevertheless it is a big improvement in in-flight entertainment from their 763's/752's. Dreamliner on return leg was excellent. Staff service and meals have always been excellent. Been flying this route for about 7 years and the airline just keeps getting better and better.,4/1/2013,5,5,5,4,5,10
Aditya Vashishta,1,Well after hearing a lots of negetive comments about Aerlineas airlines I was a bit apprehensive but the fare was almost half from MEL-RIO. I found the service better and aircraft was old but with more legroom. The crew was also good and trying to help passengers as it was a long flight of 16 hrs. Food was OK and they should improve their entertainment service. Overall we enjoyed and would definitely go again.,8/28/2012,5,4,3,2,4,8
A Hahn,1,My family and I flew from Newark NJ to Fort Lauderdale FL return. Checking-in and boarding the flight to FLL went very smooth - in fact smoother than my previous flight with United Airlines. Onboard the flight in both directions the seats in the standard section were comfortable and of course we had the free DirectTV service. You also had free access to certain SiriusXM stations as well. The service overall onboard was good giving us good complimentary drinks and snacks. Checking-in and boarding the flight to EWR was smooth even though there was 15-minute delay due to a deluge at the airport. The only consequence is that if you don't bring your headset you would have to pay for your own which is $2. Before they used to give them away for free but now they're charging for it.,6/6/2012,4,4,5,5,4,9
Alexandra Jarvis,1,"I had a mixed opinion of Oman Air. On the first flight to Muscat from London, staff were quite miserable and didn't seem happy to help (unlike budget airlines I've used in Europe, anyway). Dinner was great, but breakfast wasn't great. The layout of the plane was quite good, and entertainment was good. On the returning flight home, staff were friendlier. I don't know if this is a cultural thing, but I just didn't find the staff very helpful or smiley, which is odd, as there is such a huge emphasis on friendliness for airline staff. Perhaps they were just having a bad day, which I understand. For the price of a return flight to Zanzibar from London flying directly to Zanzibar after a quick transfer in Oman, I would travel with Oman Air again. On a superficial note I thought the airline outfit for the staff was beautiful, very smart and the staff looked amazing!",7/9/2015,4,3,3,4,2,6
Adnan Mir,1,Mumbai-Bangalore. Seats terribly cramped and lack of space in the above luggage bins.

Overall for a short haul trip not bad and value for money.,7/21/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,5
A Merchant,1,Only four people on my flight so we sat where we liked. Checking in was therefore a formality. As it was a small propeller plane it felt like getting on a private jet (albeit quite worn inside and shared with others). No cabin crew on board (no need for a 45 min journey to Edmonton). It's cheaper than its bigger rivals offering a more personal service as you would expect for a local airline and certainly a better option than taking the coach. Professional and efficient so would use again.,8/7/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
A Haka,1,HEL-AMS return. Our departure was during the morning hours which are one of the busiest at Helsinki airport. Despite of this Finnair's check-in was handled extremely efficiently with all the check-in counters staffed. Extremely well done! Check-in at Amsterdam airport was not as efficient with only two check-in agents present and they seemed like they're fed up with their jobs. Both flights were good with clean aircraft and very friendly crew. The pilots also kept the passengers up to date with flight information. Food was just a sandwich with a choice of soft drink. Both flights were on-time.,6/11/2013,5,4,3,3,5,9
Alexandre Coias,1,"A good experience with TAP. This is the fifth time this year that I am flying with them. A meal, a pre booked seat and 23 kgs baggage allowance is a good deal.

A Midkiff,1,"This was my first time to fly Domestic First Class on United Airlines. My first thoughts were how the cabin service reminded me of what economy class once was when I flew as a teenager in the late 1970's. This trip was from SEA to ORD to IND and back. Zone 1 boarding: Great! Initial cabin greeting was pleasant and prompt. Seat comfort good. Seat pitch a bit tight. Drink and snack service: very good. Flight Attendants: If I ran my own airline I would hire each attendant that I encountered on this trip. Meal service was good no complaints. Inflight entertainment: On the outbound trip there seemed to be a good selection that I could watch no charge on my own device. Connectivity needs to be simplified! On the return part of my trip the equipment was Inop. This is the second US carrier that I've encountered with Inop inflight equipment. United you need to spend more time making sure your equipment works. ""Just Good Enough"" is not good enough!",6/1/2015,4,4,4,2,5,8
Adree Farhan bin Adam,1,9/10/2013. BKK-KUL. On their new B737-800. Love the interior design. Sky-interior and leather seat. Good legroom for 2 hours flight. Staff service was amazing.

A Hall,1,I travelled premium economy on Air Canada from Vancouver to Heathrow. This product is very good value in my opinion. Seats were similar to AC domestic standard business class about 38' or more pitch two on the sides. The dinner meal was a condensed business class meal in my opinion having travelled in that class previously. The wine drinks service was excellent staff were very attentive. Morning meal more standard fare but fine. Air Canada has come a long way in service over the past few years and I would definitely choose them over any American carrier and many European ones. I thought the dinner meal was better than what I ate on united first class. UA could take lessons from AC.,8/5/2014,5,4,4,4,5,10
Alexey Efimov,1,Moscow-Tenerife on A330-300 long haul. The service was incredible (actually as usual on Aeroflot long haul flights in business class compared to short haul it is better). Our plane was delayed but we arrived only 7 minutes later than it was proposed). Cabin was originally designed for EgyptAir and it was very good. Entertainment system has a big variety of films and all films can be watched in either Russian or English. In my opinion Aeroflot on long hauls is much better than the majority of other European airlines.,8/5/2013,4,5,5,5,5,10

Flight to Brisbane was eventually about an hour and a half late but the return flight was cancelled after waiting in the check in queue for about 2 hours.

Alexios Doukas,1,Munich - Ponta Delgada and return; stop-over in Porto. Both flights departed on time and arrived slightly ahead of schedule. The crews were caring friendly and professional. Basic in-flight entertainment (music film/short videos and information regarding the Azores) which is more than enough for the time one spends on-board. Full meal and drinks service on the Munich - Porto sector snacks and drinks on the Porto - Ponta Delgada sector. A nice and well-presented magazine with useful information for anyone travelling to the Azores. The ground staff in Ponta Delgada was also very professional and helpful (especially concerning inquires on hurricane Nadine and its effect on our flight). Overall great value for money a professional airline offering basic and good service with a flavour of Azorean culture. It has been a very pleasant experience I would definitely fly SATA again.,9/23/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
Adrian Holt,1,I flew LHR to Melbourne return over the Xmas period 2012. We booked RBA as it was around Â£400 cheaper than any other airline. Bag drop at the airport was efficient and I highly recommend online check-in as the line to drop bags off in this line was about 4 people vs the 50 or so in the non online check in. The weights for checking luggage was not strictly enforced but hand luggage was strictly enforced. On board there was more leg room than many I have travelled on which was great. Food was tasty although they do run out of the popular items quickly. Adding ice cream for the sweet was a nice touch. The cabin crew were very efficient and helpful. A press of the call button and they were with you within 20 seconds and always happy to help. All crews were far and above in terms of professionalism and helpfulness. I can highly recommend RBA for an efficient friendly airline.,1/2/2013,5,4,4,3,5,8
A Miller-Chan,1,I flew with my four and a half year old daughter on the 10am flight to Newark. This was our 3rd flight with Silverjet. As our previous experience with them was so exceptional; and we had a very tight three night turnaround; we opted once again to fly with them. My husband drove us through a blizzard to the terminal on the morning of the flight. As we expected there was a delayed take-off due to the need for de-icing. The ground crew were delightful and allowed my husband to join us for coffee before we boarded. Once onboard I enquired about the child pack for my daughter. I was told that you now give these out in the terminal. Flight crew were very apologetic and I was assured that one would be waiting for us upon arrival and it was! The last 45 minutes of the flight were extremely turbulent. I have never been sick during air travel before but actually became hideously sick during landing. I was terribly embarrassed and also concerned for my daughter as I knew she was frightened. The cabin crew were all so supportive kind and reassuring. They were professional and helped my daughter as well. I was met at the plane with a wheelchair by a wonderful young woman. She took care of everything right up until I got into the town car and reassured my young daughter all the way through. On our return to Newark for the 7:30 return flight to Luton we were greeted by the same young woman who had assisted me and the other ground crew. We were greeted by name and asked how I was feeling. The flight to Luton was excellent and I my daughter and I both slept for 5 hours. We arrived early to Luton and it was wonderful to be able to return to the terminal where we were greeted once again by name! Is the lounge or the seat as good as Virgin upper no; but the service and check in is superior. One thing to note is how child friendly they are. Silverjet now offers a child discount on all tickets as well. I am looking forward to my next flight with them in July.,4/1/2008,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Halpern,0,Flight from NY La Guardia to Cleveland OH at 01.15am email said flight would be delayed by 2 hours. Delayed our taxi to airport by 2 hours. Got to airport to find flight now cancelled but no email communication from Delta no phone call just the pleasure of an extra 1.5 hours at the airport as they had rebooked us onto 3.20 flight. Staff no training in apologising to passengers for inconvenience - staff couldn't give a damn. Although travelling with my husband they couldn't be bothered to sit us together. So was the flight cancelled for bad weather? I don't think so. Too many additional reasons given eg staff not able to fly as on duty too long etc. We then discovered that the earlier flight had been cancelled too. Could this have been about consolidation. Advice don't travel with them if you can avoid them.,6/13/2014,1,2,1,0,1,NaN
Alf Butov,0,Tajik Air from Moscow DME to Khujand. Well apart from the fact that the plane was really very old (Tupolev 154B-2)and the staff - quite rude and depressed there was a seating problem as the seats were not marked in the cabin so 'first come first served'. There was even scotch tape on the windows! During the entire flight I felt a bit scared as I honestly thought we were going to have major problems with the aircraft. However after a troublesome 4 hour flight we landed safely in Khujand. On my way back - almost the same story. This time the plane was a bit better taken care of but still it seemed as though I returned back to the time I was a kid when Tupolev 154 B-2 series was at the peak of popularity with Aeroflot. The security check at Khujand airport was terrible and we had to let all the Tajiks pass through before we were finally let in. Consequently we were the last to enter the cabin. Upon entering it we realized the plane was full and there seemed to be no seats for us. A very 'helpful' cabin attendant said (I am not joking here) You should have come earlier! We hardly managed to find seats for us and were very happy to eventually land in Moscow after a 4 hour turmoil. What an experience!! A really lifetime impressions!!,4/9/2007,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
Adrian Kessler,1,Geneva-Istanbul (A319) - Istanbul-Kuala Lumpur (A340-300) on August 6th-7th 2013. Flight from Geneva to Istanbul was smooth nothing special. Flight from Istanbul to KL service-wise was flawless and seamless. Very attentive service needs were taken care of before you asked and very good food although I have had even better food on other THY flights. My real issue is with the business class seat sleeping comfort on the A340-300.I am not sure at what angle the seat reclines but it is pretty nasty I was annoyed because the ticket price was pretty high. I wonder why Turkish a forward looking airline as using the A340-300 on the IST-KL run with this seating arrangement in business class. I just hope that Turkish will either change the planes on the IST-KL run or do something about the seating in their A340-300.,10/2/2013,3,2,5,5,5,8

A Milossavlyevich,0,"BEG-LCA and back. Boarding in Belgrade chaotic taking place in a small non-refurbished gate (A8) that can't fit the number of people on an A320 even though our flight wasn't full. Passengers behavior on board appalling same as the attitude of the stewards and FA's. The flight was like a flying bazaar Legroom is none. Takeoff and landing done in an unpleasant manner even though the weather was fine (I'm a frequent traveler). On return boarding at Larnaca gate 41 the one with the stairs. Many people got overcharged for hand-luggage. Crew attentive this time around and passengers well behaved. Got moved to the emergency seat for free. The pilot was a true professional landing excellent. As you can see Wizz Air can be hit and miss. To use only if you're light on luggage and able to respect the stingent rules that could easily make your ""cheap"" ticket skyrocket above the price of the one of a regular airline.

A Hansen,0,I am an experienced flyer but had never flown with WestJet until a few days ago and I will never fly with them again. The service on the Cancun to Toronto flight was appalling. I was flying with my sister who has 2 young children. We were boarded first but only after approaching the attendants as there was no pre-boarding call. Once on the plane my sister asked if she could go to the back to stand with her 5 month old child to put him to sleep while the plane was loading. The flight attendant said no there was no room so have a seat. After take off passengers were bombarded with merchandise play books (as there was no in-flight entertainment provided) headsets food drinks duty free. You had brief mins. of opportunity to go to the washroom as the aisles were always blocked by carts and you were told to sit down and wait while they finished their task. The staff were very unprofessional and rude. At the end of the flight passengers were not even acknowledged as all the attendants were at the back of the plane talking amongst each other.,5/20/2013,1,1,1,1,1,NaN
Alfredo Acosta,1,6 hours flight from UIO-GRU and back A319 plane a kind of old without onboard entertainment such as personal video system of something like. Food was really good and some generous drinks too. Cabin crew members in both flights were not as much friendly as they should. They should improve personal attention and cordiality. Meanwhile the cost of 430 USD for a flight that usually cost 700 is worth investment.,3/14/2014,0,0,0,0,0,7
Ali Arif,1,London Heathrow-Jeddah Medina-Jeddah Jeddah-London Heathrow. Flight hostesses nice food excellent. Nice 777-286ER on way to Jeddah from London Heathrow brilliant in-flight entertainment including all the new movies and songs. Medina-Jeddah small Embraer 170 was a bit turbulent but the hostesses did all they could to keep passengers calm. Jeddah-London Heathrow 777-386ER was really nice clean. Gave a variety of foods including chicken and fish. All food was warm and water ice cold. Would definitely recommend.,4/7/2014,5,4,5,5,5,10
Adrian Montgomery,0,Arrived in Vietnam with two Jetstar Pacific flights pre-booked. Flight 592 from Ho Chi Minh city to Danang on Nov 10th and a return Flight 593 on Nov 14th. Both were cancelled. I spent 15 minutes on Nov 10th trying to get them to answer their phone. I went out to the Airport early which meant I had an entire afternoon to watch the delays postponements and lack of information. The substitute flight I was given left over an hour late so I didn't get to Danang until after dark. I heard that my 13.35 return flight to Ho Chi Minh city was also cancelled and that they had rebooked me on a much later flight which would make me miss my International Connection out of Vietnam I had to waste more time trying to change this. Eventually I was forced get up at 5 am to take an early morning flight instead meaning I had to waste 7 hours in HCMC airport. I will never fly with them again.,11/29/2012,2,3,0,0,3,NaN
A Milossavlyevich,1,BEY-BAH-MAA. A pleasant surprise overall A320 in excellent condition on both legs. Catering between average (per ME standards) and mediocre in quality crew definitely not motivated some very stressed. Both flights departed and arrived on time. The service is not a bliss but being cheaper than lowcost's on this leg makes them definitely value for money and under those conditions I would fly them again.,1/27/2012,4,4,2,0,2,6
A Hara,0,"SHA-LJG return. It is the worst flight experience in my life. The flight to Shanghai was canceled due to airport facility problem and stranded passengers were taken to a hotel. Around 0:00 AM we were suddenly required to depart and took a flight to Kunming. We arrived at Kunming around 2:30 AM. The airport staff said the passengers to wait in a hotel until the alternative flight to Shanghai which departed at 10:00 AM. However they said I (and another passenger) had to take another flight which departed at 9:00am and did not give us a hotel room. Instead they took us a dirty smelly office and said us to sleep there. Since the only one sofa was occupied by the other passenger I had no place to sleep other than the floor. I complained about the change and requested a decent place to sleep but they were just saying ""No"" and did nothing except saying I was not the only one who had no room and what I could do was to wake up an employee and ask him to share his room or sleep on arrayed chairs. I tried to get a room by myself but the nearest hotel was full and they said there was no taxi or bus in the midnight. I was forced to spend the night on a dirty hard floor while the others were sleeping in a hotel. Of course I was not able to sleep at all and felt sick. Such an inhuman treatment should not be allowed even when the cancellation is not the airline's fault. Avoid Shanghai Airlines or you will be treated as trash.",11/3/2009,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
Ali Geldieva,1,Flew from Boston to Punta Cana round-trip. Great experience except for the food selection. The entertainment was great lots of choices and the plane arrived in Punta Cana ahead of schedule! Staff pretty friendly and plenty of leg room.

A Mir,0,KUL-CMB-BLR. Trip to forget. Checked in Kuala Lumpur and was told I would not be able to board the aircraft until I produce a photo copy of my credit card for the ticket purchased. Went all over KUL airport to find a computer that can print PDF documents finally found one. Went again to check in counter and was told flight was delayed. I ended up finally making it to CMB but missed my connecting flight to BLR. Was put up in the airport transit hotel and flew in the morning to Chennai where I was told to catch a Jet Airways flight at SriLankan Airlines expense. All in all a terrible experience will think twice about flying this airline again.,12/20/2010,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
Adrian Pritchard,1,"Moscow Domodedovo-London Gatwick. Like the outbound journey a week before baggage drop was far too long! Over an hour! The most frustrating thing being the Easyjet Plus desk was open and hardly being used! Also I really don't understand why on both flights I had to carry my bag across the airport to ""oversized baggage"" when it wasn't and I wasn't charged extra. In flight crew were lovely really warm and friendly. They were having problems with my card while purchasing beverages but were patient. Flight was slightly delayed on way out (airport's fault not Ryanair) but made up for time and arrived early.",7/14/2013,4,4,4,NaN,5,9
A Hare,0,We found the Royal Brunei Airline experience was not good for families with young children. The only positive was that air hosts/esses were generally helpful and friendly. In our purchased tickets it said nothing about the additional stopover in Dubai. This was very unsettling for little ones trying to sleep then had to walk the circuit of Dubai airport waiting over an hour only to get back on the plane. Then a wait of 2.5 hours before it quietened down enough for them to sleep. Kids meals were not great and our children are not normally fussy. Kids entertainment was also poor. I would definitely recommend taking your ipad. Finally as we left Heathrow to travel back to Melbourne we purchased some gifts. Being aware of the alcohol restrictions on the plane I clarified this with the sales assistant who assured me it was ok to take aboard. Nothing was mentioned about the alcohol when boarding on the plane at Heathrow. Nor through the Dubai check. However at the last point it was confiscated in Brunei. Everyone felt extremely frustrated and angry that this was not made clear before purchases were made. Obviously no one would have wasted their money if they knew it would be taken away. Overall I would not recommend this airline to families with young children.,10/18/2012,3,4,2,2,4,3
Ali McLeod,1,Edinburgh to Malaga on July 31st. Plane was really old. Had head lights inside at knee level. 10 mins in there was a massive clunk and a rush of air. Clearly not normal. Much activity from flight crew. Captain came over the tannoy to say landing gear had dropped and we had to land. Circled Leeds for nearly 2 hours with the landing gear down to burn off fuel. Updates were given frequently. Pretty hard landing but there was a plane waiting to take us on to Malaga and we were only 3 hours late. Compensation was a soft drink on the next flight? Bit disappointing but as I said was all handled very well.,8/15/2013,4,4,3,NaN,5,6
Adrian Stavrakis,1,Went from SKG to STR and after a week the other way around. My flights were A3510 and A3511. Excellent aircraft clean no malfunctioning seats inflight maps 2 captain announcements one the standard and one extra that we would experience some turbulence over Belgrade. Star-Alliance stylished meals served hot enough beverage and coffee happy to help flight attendants ultra-fast baggage drop-off and mobile check- in. I didn't even have to print my boarding pass. Highly recommended!,7/13/2012,5,5,5,4,5,10
A Mitchell,0,Recently flew Gatwick to Kiev return in business. Bets thing about business was that cabin was quiet and seats had reasonably generous leg room. Drink first offered about 45 minutes after take off in both directions (I got the impression that the crew were under orders not to serve too many drinks as part of a cost-cutting exercise). Food okay. No IFE on either of these flights. Check in at Kiev was hopeless. Despite there being no one in front of me when I arrived at the business class desk to check in the agent was disinterested and reading her magazine and directed me to a free economy desk adjacent. Beware of Kiev- you can't check in (and proceed to lounge) until 2 hours before your flight is ready to depart. Very limited choice of places to eat and drink at airport airside. I paid Â£7.50 for a pint of beer in airport cafe and at lunch a main course was about Â£20 Â£25. Lounge spacious but extremely limited range of drinks- no whisky only American bourbon. It is the only lounge that I have been in where we were entertained by a live pianist!,11/16/2008,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,3
Ali Nike,1,"Overall the journey was good. The breakfast was okay, we were served sandwiches which weren't that appetizing.

Ali Soufan,0,BEY-LHR via Istanbul. Flight was delayed by 45 mins to depart from Beirut. Flight was packed from Beirut to Istanbul operated by an old A321 with no personal TV. To be honest one of the things that was brought to my attention the carelessness of the cabin crew in checking seat belts and providing the appropriate safety demonstrations no announcement was made from the captain at all during the whole flight. Nevertheless once we got to Istanbul I nearly made my connecting flight to LHR. Again flight was operated by an A321 with no ptv which I found very surprising. Again service was not great however they served good food. Overall would not fly again with them due to their very tired aircraft's being used on the route and due to the service of both the cabin crew and the hassle for connecting passengers in Istanbul.,10/8/2014,3,2,4,1,1,2
A Moffatt,0,"I was very disappointed by the Singapore Airlines business class travel experienced recently. My partner and I flew from Australia to Europe and back with Singapore Airlines three sectors on the A380 and one on a B777. Surprisingly the B777 provided the more comfortable experience despite the lack of a fully flat bed. The seats on the A380 are extremely wide (which was the initial draw card and the reason for spending $1500 more than for Cathay Pacific) but you have to sit in them diagonally to reach the foot rest - this was comfortable for about 5 minutes. The beds in the fully flat position are quite comfortable but unlike other business class seats there is no smooth transition from sitting to lying - you are required to 'make' the bed. When in the bed position there is no comfortable backrest to allow you to sit comfortably - hence the large number of business travellers seen sitting cross-legged in bed throughout the flight! Furthermore the seats are leather but are very worn sometimes damaged and the headrests do not stay in position. There are no individual amenities kits (just an eye mask and some slippers) - a selection of items are available in the toilet cubicles. There are no pyjamas as on some other airlines. The service was highly variable. The worst sector by far was from Singapore to Heathrow. The staff were anything but attentive the bathrooms were unclean and food was dreadful. Garlic bread was cold and rock hard and the ""Book the Cook"" proved to be extremely disappointing. The lobster thermidore was a complete let-down and looked nothing like the pictures posted online by the airline and other travellers. The nut-encrusted veal was unfortunately the toughest and coldest piece of meal I have had on a flight and the ""crust"" was more like a soggy coating. That said the meals that were not pre-ordered were generally of very high quality. The entertainment system was excellent. Having previous travelled in Business Class with Qantas and Cathay Pacific I would not hesitate to return to these two in preference to Singapore Airlines in future.",5/16/2014,2,2,4,5,3,4
A Harrison,0,Just returned from flight Barbados the worst airline we have travelled on. Booked extra leg room this was row 30 firstly seat near window should not have been charged for also not told toilets were there. People crowded there. Had long delay at Barbados airport and not 1 person from company came to departure lounge nothing offered in about 8hrs then had to collect baggage and go to different hotels at midnight then collected from hotels and once again taken to airport. Absolutely horrendous finally arrived in Manchester on Monday morning at 7am instead of Sunday at 4am.,3/12/2014,1,1,3,2,3,NaN
A Hashim,1,Despite the delay departure of 30 mins from Athens to Tirana due to system's break down the flight went smoothly. I was excited onboard DHC-8-400 for the first time.

A Moon,0,ANA failed to alert passengers about its cancelled flight ORD-Narita on June 2nd even though they knew 14 hours in advance that the plane never left Narita. The Passenger Reps couldn't be bothered to check other flight availability. Only after being prodded did they miraculously found a seat on United Airlines departing within 2 hours of its cancelled flight. I understand that technical issues are unavoidable but the total lack of accountability about the customer experience was shocking! ANA was previously known for its customer service (that we expect from Japanese airlines) but don't be fooled. I found ANA employees to be unprofessional at best rude at worst.,6/10/2010,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
Alimul H Chowdhury,0,I made 2 trips to Dhaka last year and both ways missed the connecting flight in Istanbul. The reason is very short lay over time which is only one hour. Though hotel accommodation was given staff are not friendly. My visa fees were not reimbursed.

A Hay,0,Decided to pay more for an economy return flight to Jamaica as I wanted to fly with Virgin (Â£200 more than their competitive airline). The last and only time I flew with them was about 10 years ago return flight to New York. Back then the return economy flight cost me Â£250 the flight had better entertainment and proper games with consoles was offered newspapers and the food and drink served was offered practically non-stop in fact I was given 2 main meals! Also very lucky on the return flight as it was practically empty we were given a glass of champagne! This time got 1 small main meal (and didn't eat the salad as it consisted of one small leaf and lots of dressing that tasted of dish water) afternoon tea consisted of 1 biscuit and tea or coffee steward gave me a look when I asked for 2 drinks and only good thing about the entertainment was the selection of films. I don't know why the stewards seemed stressed when the plane was half full! Also on return flight back staff at the airport had an attitude and didn't even welcome or say hello to me! They insisted I put items from my hand luggage into my suitcase as it was 1 kilo over! All this wonderful service cost me just under Â£800 for a return ticket! My friend flew with American airlines (via Miami) and basically got the same service and quality food and drinks I had from my original Virgin flight 10 years ago. So in conclusion I will never fly with Virgin again.,5/11/2014,1,1,1,3,1,3
A Moore,0,Plane was 1 hour late (unexplained) on the outbound BGI-SVG sector but thankfully as flight was not totally full luggage did travel. No such luck on the return leg. It was all the passengers who were connecting on to UK flights whose luggage didn't arrive and they had been clearly labelled as connecting luggage in St Vincent. We saw our luggage next to the baggage hold and foolishly thought that would mean it would travel - but no don't be fooled! It will now apparently be sent on a day later as it will miss the UK flight - not so great when you have yet another sector at the other end. Not sure if we'll ever see it again!,6/16/2013,2,3,1,0,2,NaN
Alison O'Connor,1,Did my usual Christmas route LHR-SNN-LHR.

Alison Williams,1,SOU-GCI-SOU. Flybe appeared a better deal at first glance but once I had a proper look and added up the extras (since when was baggage considered an 'extra'?) it didn't look so good. I was also irritated that they were trying to mislead me about the total cost of their flights. So I booked Blue Islands and very glad I did. They're using the Dornier 328 on this route now and it's more comfortable than I'd expected for this size of plane (a 31 seater). They managed a cold drinks service in the just over 30 minute flight (and we arrived early both ways.) The lounge at GCI is excellent - lots of choice of hot and cold drinks and biscuits. All in all it was a more personal better quality of service than I'm used to for a very reasonable and very clear price. I'd certainly recommend them.,7/27/2009,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,5
A Morgan,1,Dublin to Cardiff return. I have used the Friday evening and return on Sunday night frequently over the last two years. They have recently had more new planes (ATR 72) prior to this the flights were invariably a few hours late. However they are now mostly less than one hour late. Service from the crew is good for a one hour flight. Parking at a remote stand in Dublin then having a bus transfer plus a lengthy walk to Arrivals. Would be good if Ryanair returned to this route.,5/25/2014,2,2,3,1,4,6
A Helman,1,"Gold Coast - Kuala Lumpur return. I flew economy out and Premium return. To avoid check-in queues I recommend the online check in it took 5 minutes at the luggage drop. Economy is a fairly comfortable although legroom is tight and for tall passengers I recommend paying the extra amount for one of the ""hot seats"" (either front rows or exit rows). The check-in did offer to block off 3 economy seats for me for an extra fee (as there was space on flight) but as a day flight I did not need to sleep. I was very impressed with the meal which also comes with a bottle of water. Other onboard food purchase items reasonably priced and a fair variety. I was looking forward to my return flight in Premium class. No need to do online check-in for Premium as there is a dedicated check-in queue for maximum of 12 Premium passengers. No business lounge for Air Asia X (pay per entry Plaza Premium Lounge available). Onboard staff offered a bottle of water lots of overhead space with only 12 passengers in the premium cabin. All passengers given a blanket and cushion. After takeoff staff offered to serve meal at a time of my choice. They also offered to hold any additional food items that I may want later in the flight. The standard meal is the same as that offered in economy class. The main benefit of Premium is the almost lie flat seat. Upon arrival we were able to exit the plane first get through passport control before other passengers. I have flown Air Asia X a number of times since their launch a few years ago and will definitely aim to fly Premium again on my future Air Asia X flights.",4/5/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,10
Alistair Baker,1,I flew LHR-PEK for a holiday on a 747-400. The plane was not that busy and the seat next to me was free which was great. The plane was clean and my seat was reasonably comfortable.

Alistair Robertson,0,I chose Air France to fly from Edinburgh to Florence through CDG. Out tickets were purchased as through tickets and I noticed that they only provided for a 50 minute connection from the AF Hop regional hub which is at the far end of the airport and only accessible by bus through immigration and on to pier E. I emailed twice to seek confirmation that this could be done and was assured on both occasions that it could. Suffice to say it cannot and our connection was missed by 20 minutes (even our case couldn't make it). This is when you fully experience the sharp end of AF's customer service staff who consider you to be something on the bottom of their shoe. We were put on the flight some 3 hrs later sitting at opposite ends of the aircraft despite me telling them my wife was a nervous flyer. During our deliberations at the desk business class went from being full to (upon further pressing) empty and being held so on the rather unlikely event of 8 people turning up half an hour before the flight and buying business class tickets. I didn't want to fly business class but simply suggested that a couple of other passengers could be upgraded freeing up two seats together for my wife and myself. I asked to speak to a manager - none were available. I was told that I was only an economy passenger and that to get anything better I would have to purchase two business class single fares amounting to almost 1000 Euros. Suffice to say when the flight took off there were 6 empty business class seats whilst I was in row 6 and my wife rather uncomfortably in row 24. We could have flown directly with Ryanair to Pisa but I prefer to fly the Flag Carrier experience for a quality of service that was sadly lacking with Air France. Next year I will be flying through Schipol with KLM.,6/7/2015,3,3,3,1,1,1
A Morrison,0,LHRâ€“CAI. Flight left 90 minutes late due to usual Heathrow congestion. They could have let us stay in the lounge rather than board a poorly ventilated plane for this time. Plane was filthy and clearly had not been cleaned in LHR (or possibly for some time). There were stains splattered across the seat next to me and trash piling up at the back of the plane in the attendantsâ€™ area near the toilets. Clearly no-one cares about the aircraft cleanliness. I was surprised that IFE was available on a relatively short (4+hr) flight with a limited choice of western movies and many more Arabic ones. No alcohol was served (not even for purchase).,5/22/2012,2,3,2,4,2,2

Allan Beamer,0,Began flying Frontier out of Williston ND some 3 years ago since they were the only carrier there. I live in Utah so would have expected basic but acceptable service. It seems the longer I continue flying with them the more the problems. Coming home to Utah this last time meant delay after delay (I had some 5 delay announcements sent to my email all after I already knew about it!) causing me to miss my connection at Denver. Almost had to stay overnight. Had been gone from home 3 months! How difficult is it to maintain their equipment? Always an issue for them. Now United and Delta are flying to North Dakota. I have to return with Frontier but won't fly them again. I'd rather fly someone else for $100 more who has their act together without the drama and adventure.

A Hickling,1,PHL-LHR on B787 seat 10A World Traveller Plus. The entire front row of the World Traveller Plus cabin are bulkhead seats and are also used as bassinets for babies so if children are travelling it is unlikely to obtain a seat in this row. The seat is definitely an improvement on its predecessor and I managed to get over 4 hours sleep due to the recline leg extension and footrest. The meal service has also improved and now has the Club World main course served together with wine in a glass and metal cutlery and a printed menu. There is also a hot towel service and drinks served before take off but in plastic cups and non-alcoholic. The service was very good but the cabin was not completely full and seats 25 passengers at maximum capacity. The entertainment system is excellent as it is the new Thales equipment. The cabin is also cleaner brighter and quieter than 777-200 and 747 equivalents.,9/17/2014,5,4,4,5,4,8
A Mueller,0,Flew HAM-DXB-BLR and returned BLR-DXB-HAM in mid-December 2014 with Emirates. Before taking this flight I'd heard the hype about Emirates being one of the best airlines so was looking forward to the trip. How far could the reality be from the hype? A long way. Where to begin? The seats are not comfortable stewardesses missed me twice when bringing drinks around and once when bringing meals (I wasn't asleep they just didn't ask and were looking away from me so I couldn't get their attention until I had to practically shout at them - which got an angry- looking glare). On the return leg from BLR to DXB I got a nosebleed in flight and wanted to ask them for tissues - I used the call button but nobody came. Waited several minutes then tried again this went on until the bleeping stopped after about 15 minutes. Not one attendant came to repeated buzzing over that time. Finally it stopped and I got out of my window seat and to the toilet to take care of it myself. I noticed during the flights to BLR and on the return that there were plenty of other people who also got no responses to their calls - they finally gave up or I saw a couple of them get up from their seats and find an attendant themselves - so ignoring passengers seems to be corporate policy. Meals are also average. All-in-all not a good experience over 4 flights with this airline - I would not recommend flying with them - I sure won't if I can avoid it.,1/5/2015,2,1,3,4,1,1
Adriana Steele,1,We live in Toronto and have flown out of Buffalo NY into Florida for years. We were delighted to find out that flights were available from Niagara Falls into Fort Lauderdale. Flight cost was a couple hundred less than other carriers for the dates we had searched. We were sure to read all of the details in traveling with this discount airline. We took advantage of checking in bags online booked seats in the exit rows for a little extra space and checked-in/printed out boarding pass before heading to the airport which not only saved money in the long run but also meant that we literally spent less than 5 min. in the fast bag drop line at Fort Lauderdale airport. On our outboard flight we were delayed getting into Niagara Falls due to a snow storm and arrived to the check in counter 15 min. prior to the scheduled departure time. They gladly took our bags and we boarded the aircraft which was delayed by a 1/2 hour due to weather for the incoming flight. On the return flight we found out 4 hours prior to our departure that the flight would be delayed by 1 hour this was a little tough to hear as we were taking a night flight which meant that we would now not arrive into Niagara Falls until 2am. All was fine and the flight left as per the delay that was noted on the companies website. We would fly this airline again have in fact already booked the family in for our Cruise out of Miami in October. Even with the added cost for bag check- in and upgrade to exit row seats we still find this airline to be much more cost effective. You can't expect to fly with a discount carrier and expect a Delta flight. The only one negative thing that we can say it that we wished that the seats on the aircraft reclined on the overnight flights.,3/10/2014,5,3,5,1,5,8
Allan Craig,0,Very disappointed in Sunwing! Outbound I wasn't able to check in online so at the airport early. Was given row 28 at rear of plane. The flight magazine was so soiled the attendant didn't like touching it. There was wads of gum stuck in the window. When food finally arrived they ran out on row 27 with only one choice for us in row 28. Leaving Mexico the Sunwing rude personal wouldn't let us carry on our luggage which was underweight and that we had carried on in Vancouver. She then gave us row 32 even thought we were 3 hours early at the terminal. She also insisted it was a direct flight to Vancouver. At 6pm we left Los Cabos and flew 55 minutes south to Puerto Vallarta sat on the ground for 50 minutes before a 4.5 hour flight to Vancouver. This was not a direct flight and not only in a non reclining chair but no food until after 9pm. Seven hours to get home from Mexico! Never again with Sunwing.,3/4/2015,2,1,1,2,2,2
A Hickling,1,Travelled to HKG on board the new A380. Boarding was efficient with a dedicated air bridge for First passengers. Welcomed on board offered champagne newspaper pyjamas and wash bag and settled into my suite. The space is more noticeable than a 747 or 777 equivalent with a wardrobe that can fit carry on baggage a jacket and shoes plus a side bin that accommodates other items. The food was excellent with the choice of a five course taster menu with accompanying wines or a la carte. There are also treats available in the first galley. Breakfast was also very good. I managed to get plenty of sleep as the aircraft is very quiet and walked around the entire plane to get a sense of scale. The crew were excellent addressed me by name engaged in conversation whilst delivering an unobtrusive service. The entertainment system was the Thales product. Plenty of choice interactive screens and no rebooting as is the case on other long haul aircraft. I couldn't fault this flight just a pity I couldn't spend longer on it. Looking forward to the return journey.,5/4/2014,5,5,5,5,5,10

Af Folscher,0,"Twice now I have flown Etihad, booked on South African code share flights, it has not been great. On the first case I was booked business class, but when I got to check-in, Etihad did not have me on the flight list on a full flight, despite SAA being able to provide the codes. I had to wait until 40 minutes before departure to know whether I would be able to fly and then it was in economy class. I was promised follow up - the flight controller even confirmed my email address - I am still waiting. The second time, today, flight EY471 from Jakarta to Abu Dhabi was delayed by three hours. I fly a lot, and I know these things happen. The proof is in how the airline treats you when they do. I am carrying a letter saying that hotels are booked if the new connection required more than eight hours waiting time. Mine requires fifteen. As I could not access a hotel (transit hotel full and I need a visa for any others) I was given food vouchers and told to wait in the terminal. I had to argue for lounge access (this time I am flying economy, but it seemed logical as lounge access Appears to me a notch down from the promised hotel accommodation). I was told it is full. Eventually the desk took pity on me and granted me five hours in the lounge. When I got to the lounge, lo and behold, it was empty. And just now Etihad refused to renew my voucher - from the mouth of an uninterested and unapologetic desk officer. I was also sent to and fro from the SAA desk to Etihad to sort out boarding passes. I have flown SAA for many years, and with many of its Star Alliance partners. I have two thoughts coming out of these experiences, one that I would not choose Etihad or an Etihad code share flight ever again if I can avoid it: even if the in-flight experience is good enough. And secondly, SAA, this partnership and the systems that support it is not running smoothly. The protocols are not sorted. Fix it.",6/13/2015,3,3,2,3,2,1
Allan Jenkins,1,We flew Honolulu to Brisbane on May 21st the flight left on time Business class cabin was full but very comfortable. Service with a smile from a young energetic flight crew. The flight was seamless the food was served well and hot totally edible. Seats were very comfortable not massive legroom but ample toilets were kept clean and fresh we arrived on time in Brisbane. It may not compare to some other Business Class offered on other airlines however for us it was value for money and we travelled in comfort the daylight flight did not cause us to have bad jetlag we would surely fly with them again on this route. Your only grumble could be the inflight entertainment which could be clumsy when eating I chose to read and sleep.,6/7/2015,5,5,5,0,5,9
A Hijmans,1,Salvadorâ€“BrasÃ­liaâ€“BelÃ©m. TAM changed my onward flight which meant a 6 hour layover in BrasÃ­lia. However they offered me a meal voucher out of their own accord which made up for the inconvenience. Flights on time and uneventful.,9/17/2012,4,3,3,3,4,7
A Murdoch,1,My husband and I booked a flight with Transat in June for Barcelona from Montreal in their Club Class. The night before departure we were bumped down to economy class. I had reserved months in advance and only for Club. Because of our distress Air Transat booked us on Option Plus class and gave us 4 seats across for added comfort. They also refunded us half of each ticket plus gift certificates for future travel. The new refurbished flights were wonderful both in Options Plus and in Club with roomy seats luxuriously long seatbelts and pampering from the flight attendants. Champagne great food wine and steady stream of special snacks and the movies were all up to date. We arrived early. Our experience with Transat was fabulous.,8/2/2014,5,5,5,5,5,10
Allan Leung,0,LIN-FCO-IST-FCO-LIN. Check-in at Linate was done over the phone so I just had to pick my boarding pass at the counter. Polite staff at the gate changed my seat on the FCO-IST to a better selection. LIN-FCO was a great flight everything smooth and good service. Flight to IST was terrible rude staff and poor food availability. Only a cookie for a 2 hr international flight. Return flight was even worse rude flight attendant and very unhelpful. Service still below standards and lacking. FCO-LIN was a delight compared to the previous flight. Flight crew was totally on another level making the flight enjoyable. No consistency on this airline and should also focus not only on their major route between Milan and Rome.,6/6/2012,2,4,1,1,2,5
Aghili Cameron,0,Dakar to Geneva. Flight from Dakar to Lisbon 2.5 hours late. Missed connecting flight and had to wait in Lisbon for 7 hours and then the flight to Geneva was 1.5 hours late. On the way back flight from Geneva was 30 min late missed connecting flight in Lisbon had to wait until the next night to take the flight to Dakar which was 2 hours late. Flight attendants were reasonably polite and helpful but food horrible. TAP is always late and you need at least 4 hours time difference between arrival and departure at Lisbon to ensure you will not miss your connecting flight.,1/8/2014,1,1,1,1,3,NaN
Allan Robins,1,JNB-CPT. This airline offers value for money. Departed on time arrived 5 minutes early clean cabin and very friendly staff.

A Hill,1,We flew on November 21st service from Auckland to London via Los Angeles LAX and had a great comfortable flight. They didn't have vegetarian meals on the plane and upon realizing my boyfriend's medical dietary restrictions the nice flight attendant made sure to get him anything he could eat. She was very attentive and sweet and both of us felt well cared for on that very very long flight. She invited me to try my first New Zealand red wine and it was lovely. The boarding process was simple check-in was easy and the in-flight entertainment options were incredible with lots of recent films.,12/3/2013,5,4,5,5,5,9

Allan Sweetser,0,Flight UA3789 August 27 2014. Boarded an almost new plane that was in pristine condition comfortable seats (travelling on miles and paid for upgrade to premium seating). Ready for a great flight left on time. The flight crew were terrible there were glares from the front of the plane to the back. Almost no eye contact with customers rude finger pointing. When the snack trolley came by they simply walked past directed their comments to the air in front of them and continued on - likely very few sales there! When coffee and drinks came by they were already past before we could even request a drink (we weren't really asked you see) and we had to call them back to get a coffee. When I went to the toilet the crew simply jerked their finger at me without saying anything and gestured me into a seat that was vacant to wait. They scowled at everyone. By the time we left the plane the people in the seats behind me across from me and the seats near the toilets (I heard them talking as well) were totally turned off by our crew. This was the fourth bad experience I have heard of with United in the past year from co-workers and friends. In fact I have as yet to hear a good experience from any of my colleagues. Also when deplaning they gave out erroneous information. They said that those with connecting flights would have their luggage forwarded and they did not need to collect it. It was wrong in that they do need to collect their luggage to go through customs. Fortunately customs officials were asking people to make sure they had their forwarded luggage. Terrible service. I was flying on miles so the value was great the plane was new and comfortable the experience the pits!,9/6/2014,5,4,1,1,1,2
A Muszynski,0,"We flew from Detroit to Myrtle Beach the flight there was fine however the flight home the seats had crumbs and the tray tables had smeared food and were just plain awful. I brought the condition of our seats to the flight attendants attention and she said ""if we can we will try to move you"" needless to say she never come back to check on us or give us something to clean up with luckily I had wipes to clean the seats and the tray tables - I was thankful it was only a two hour flight. A very long two hours.",9/19/2014,3,4,3,1,3,4
Ahda Fajri,1,PUS-GMP. User-friendly website made the ticket purchasing easy. Departure delayed 20 minutes but the plane arrived on time in GMP. Orange juice and water served on a very short flight. FAs were friendly and efficient. Seat pitch and leg room may be a bit tight but I believe it's common for an LCC. Overall a great choice for those who want to take a domestic flight in South Korea.,4/22/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
A Nanji,0,Flight from YYZ to YQB was re-directed back to YYZ with only vague explanation about poor conditions (no mention about this prior to leaving Toronto first time we were told was 15 minutes before our expected arrival time in Quebec). I can completely understand that poor weather conditions are not Westjet's fault. However during the same period of time 2 Air Canada flights successfully landed at YQB (one from YUL and another from YYZ) with yet another leaving YYZ for YQB at the time as our plane arrived back in Toronto. Instead of refuelling and heading back to YQB flight was cancelled and we were left to fly the following day delaying arrival by 14 hours for a 1 hour flight. It is clear Westjet does not have the capacity to deal with extenuating circumstances leaving their customers out of luck.,5/1/2014,1,3,2,3,1,1
Allen Hull,1,Royal Brunei Business Class Perth-LHR-Perth. All flights on time check-in smooth and quick and inflight service courteous and efficient. We thought the food was as good or better than we had received on flights with other major airlines and you could ask for it whenever you wanted it. Soft drinks were readily supplied and the TV screens worked perfectly. While the terminal at Brunei might not be exciting (it has very few shops) the Business Class lounge is comfortable quiet with an attractive range of food. While the 2 stops (Dubai and Brunei) do extend the trip duration there is an advantage in having the longest leg limited to about 8 hours before you can get out and walk about.,7/6/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,10
Ahmad Johnson,1,Flew JED-JNB. Jeddah airport is a nightmare though the Saudia terminal has quite a nice Duty Free shop. Flight announcements are made very unprofessionally and rudely. Taken from the terminal to plane in a bus which took approximately 10 minutes. I really hope that they install airbridges in the new airport. Boeing 777-200 is used on this route. Cabin is quite clean and the prayer facility is a bonus. Meals have got to be even worse than Egyptair. Toilets are well stocked and inflight entertainment is sufficient and up to date. Seat is quite comfortable but the headrest is like a rock. Managed to pull about an hours sleep. 97% of the flight attendants just do their job without a smile while the other 3% are slightly better. All in all I will fly with them again.,5/7/2014,3,4,2,4,2,7
A Hinze,1,FRA-MAD-SCL: cabin and seats looked like new. The comfortable seats could be folded flat and we slept very well. The meals and beverages were well above our expectations as the service was.,1/19/2015,4,5,5,0,5,10
A Nathaniel,1,I had an excellent flight from MEX to JFK on New Year's Day on one of their new 787s. Check-in staff was helpful and well-organized. We boarded and left on time. Cabin staff was professional and friendly; the breakfast frittata was great and there was a variety of movies to choose from during the flight. They even offered wine in Economy Class. The 787 is a great plane and flying in this plane was a great experience. We arrived at JFK 30 minutes early.,1/2/2014,5,5,5,4,5,10
Allen Sizemore,0,My original flight was scheduled to depart Fort Lauderdale FL on 6/8/14 at 1.45pm. The flight was delayed until 4.15. All of a sudden at 2.45 the entire flight was cancelled with no explanation. Allegiant would not help us with hotel arrangements transportation or meal vouchers.

A Hoffmann,0,FRA via ADD to Kilimanjaro and back from Dar Es Salaam with Ethiopian in business class (unfortunately fully paid by us not an upgrade or anything). 3 of 4 legs were flown on Airbus 767-300 of very senior age correspondingly they had no or inadequate inflight entertainment systems. Service was okay and reasonably attentive on two legs (ADD-KIL and ADD-FRA). On FRA-ADD it was inattentive and sloppy we were served our food with plastic cutlery food was indelible. Worst of all: DAR-ADD serviced by a Bombardier turboprop instead a small Boeing flight took nearly 4 hours instead of 2 hrs 40 mins no inflight entertainment our allocated seats were occupied until stop- over in Zanzibar virtually no service (one glass of water and we are still talking business class) no leg room nothing. Pillows/blankets: we had the choice to pick up the leftovers from the previous flight from the floor have none at all.

Both times were extremely nice even with very short flights like Zurich-Milano you feel taken care of. Zurich-Cairo flight was very comfortable entertainment system was good. On the bad side the cabin crew repeated instructions every time in at least 4 languages (English French German and Swiss) it got a bit much sometimes.,11/8/2012,5,5,5,4,5,9
A Nelson,0,Flew HKG-DPS-HKG. First time in Cathay economy (usually a Star Alliance customer). Shocked at the lack of cleanliness on the plane. My seat was stained and had crumbs there was gum stuck to the seat frame in front of me as well as had jagged metal sticking out which kept grazing my skin and the blanket distributed had long hairs (not mine) all over it. Crumbs were all over the floor. Was disappointed with the poor food served the lack of water and the atrocious IFE. Had to repeatedly ask for the right headphones (not standard old fashioned) as I was given the wrong ones for the outlet.,12/3/2013,3,1,2,1,1,3
Allison Garetto ,0,"The flight attendants were very rude, and the media system was broken which didn't help an 8 hour flight. Kept asking for updates about it and the flight attendants didn't acknowledge it. They only came around with drinks once. Food was inedible, and the leg room was small even for an airplane. I've flown internationally many times before and Aer Lingus was the worst in my opinion.",7/20/2015,1,1,1,1,1,1
Ahmad Rezaei,0,Melbourne to Bangkok not good at all had delay for 3 hours without any reason they just postpone the flight every 15mins without any explanation. It's not an international airline it may be suitable for domestic flight inside Brunei.,7/14/2013,2,3,3,2,3,NaN
A Holster,1,Flew ORD-TXL-STR STR-TXL-ORD. Was nervous after reading all of the comments here but the flight was very good. The IFE was perfect small TVs on the back of every seat in economy with more than enough movies TV shows music and games. Food was decent enough for the price water was served periodically. 5 bathrooms: more than enough. Staff was pleasant enough. Only problem is that the 2 hour layover in Berlin Tegel was hell. Berlin-Tegel Airport is designed terribly and was under construction when I flew but that isn't Air Berlin's fault.,7/29/2014,5,3,4,5,4,9
Allison Mulvaney,0,Never again. We booked to travel from Manchester to Orlando. The aircraft in both directions was old cramped and uncomfortable. The temperature of the cabin was inconsistent. The entertainment was rubbish no seat back TVs which have always been a standard for all international flights that we have travelled on. The aisle TVs could not be seen from window seats which was pointless and dark sections of the movie could not be seen at all. Food was terrible my salad arrived uncovered and food was average. Ground crew were frantically trying to get people to give up seats flight was overbooked with many families not sitting together and children split from their parents on the flight! AA was not much cheaper than my other flight options. Avoid travelling with them!,11/3/2014,2,1,1,1,2,1
A Newman,0,"Used Monarch to fly from Lanzarote - Manchester 2nd June. I am compelled to write a review as the seat quality was the worst I have ever experienced on any form of transport. Literally old bus seats are better. The seats are narrow not cushioned no legroom nowhere to store anything eg sweets magazines. I am 6"" and 13.5 stone. My head was above the seats my knees touched the seat in front and there is just no room. The flight was a night - I was with my kids who were trying to sleep - the stewardesses kept waking them up - unforgivable. We travelled to Lanzarote on Thomas Cook - I sincerely regret choosing Monarch for return fight and will Never use them again.",6/12/2014,1,1,0,1,2,1

CMB-BKK-CMB on an older Emirates A340 which was excellent AVOD again. Connection on return was 22 hours so picked up from aircraft door and transferred to a 5* city centre hotel. Breakfast and Lunch provided. Very impressed all round especially for the price paid.,4/10/2012,5,4,5,5,5,9
A Ngui,0,Flew YEG-YYZ-YEG April 22 and May 2 return. Was using their A320 with 3-3 abreast in Economy. Flight was 99% full and most travellers already paid and selected their seats. When my turn for the 24 hour seat selection check-in comes the reservation system selected what was left for me spouse and 2 children. With it being 3-3 we got the middle and aisle of either side in row 32 BCDE. This is the last row because the ones behind us were reserved for crew only. Its gets annoying as the 2 lavatories lineups extend past your row so you get a constant flow of people going in the almost 4 hour flight. Meals for purchase are fine for those that want it. The thing that ticked me off was only beverages were served complimentary. No snacks at all on this flight. There is one FA for business class cabin while two for the economy cabin. FAs are there to do their jobs and that is it. The boarding call in YEG was good where they actually boarded the Zone 3 properly by calling out pax with children board first and enough advance notice was given. In YYZ forget that. Zone 3 was not properly announced and it jumped from announcing Zone 1 hasty Zone 2 and a hurried Zone 3 general boarding with not enough time for parents with young children to board first announced. Its seems like a mess. I had to pay for my stroller since its not the umbrella type and their small dimensions. $25 each way. Really pathetic domestic service for AC as its a flag carrier and does not seem to be like one. Seating is the older one but legroom and seat pitch seems small already. Imagine if they decide to go with their high density seating like in their new 777s. When the person in front of me reclines I almost hit my knees.,5/10/2015,2,2,1,3,2,5

Ally Jane Bryant,0,I flew into Oslo on Thursday 5 March for a few days in the city before a planned trip up north to Tromso to see the Northern lights which was the soul purpose of the trip. How odd it was that we were not even notified that we were flying into an air strike that had already started! Severely annoyed at the total lack of communication shown by this airline. We only found out that our flight had been cancelled up to Tromso by testing our non existing translation skills on a news report! All internal flights cancelled yet no one tells us anything on the email. Trying to call or have live chat was a complete disaster zone as we just couldn't get through. Poor show Norwegian very poor show! After 2 cancellations on our internal flights we have now booked to return to London at a cost to us as we simply couldn't get through to Norwegian to rebook though we will follow though when back in London. I am done with this airline.,3/17/2015,1,1,3,3,3,NaN
Ahmed Emad ,0,"I was travelling from Edmonton, CA to Cairo, Egypt on Monday July 6th 2015 on flight AC 8153, with my 17 and 15 years old children and my 7 month old baby. We were supposed to catch flight AC 852 from Calgary to London, however, there was a 2.5 hour delay and accordingly there was a risk that we would miss our flight from London to Cairo. I went to the Air Canada customer service, who told us that if we missed our flight we would be compensated. However, on flight from Calgary to London I was disappointed once again, I asked the flight attendant for a can opener because I wanted to open my baby's formula but they said they didn't have one. It was very inconvenient considering that the flight was 9 hours long. They didn't give me extra food or any baby food (which was supposed to be provided since they knew there was going to be a baby on board). When we got to London at 2.57 pm, we, obviously with no surprise, missed our next flight that was planned to depart at 3pm. We were booked for the flight that leaves at 10.30 pm, thus making us stay at the airport for 7.5 hours! We were treated with no respect whatsoever. We were just given vouchers and told that was all they could do for us. Finally when we got to our final destination, adding to all the hassle we faced, our luggage had not been put on our flight and we had to wait for almost 48 hours before we got them.

Alois Leitner,0,"Yesterday OTP-VIE evening flight. Booked online seat 22F in an Airbus 320. Surprisingly plane changed to outdated Fokker 100 so the seat was now in the last row half a meter away from the engine. Because of this change complete chaos occurred Fokker has seats 2-3 Airbus 3-3 so a lot of passengers had seat numbers which didn't exist in the Fokker and 20 passengers was booked on the 22.30 flight. I am 171 cm but I had problems getting into the seat. I could not even read a magazine and opening the table tray ended in the middle of my chest with an angle of 45 degrees. After starting the engines it was so loud I couldn't understand a single word of the safety instructions neither the captains speech. Service is only a 5g-bag of pretzels or a sweet bar and some drinks even this small things are difficult to handle if you cannot open the tray-table. Would be interesting if you order a meal online before for 15 Euros how to eat that? The seat pocket in front of me was full of garbage napkins pretzel-bags. In the past we were proud of our national carrier slogan was ""service is our success"". Now they claim to be a 4-star airline in fact the are a high price airline with low service outdated planes. I cannot recommend Austrian.",9/19/2014,1,1,1,1,2,1
A Huggett,1,"BKK-SYD on a 777-300ER. Emirates will always score points when I travel on their A380s and 77Ws. The IFE is brilliant and the food and beverage service is excellent for an economy class product. This flight was let down a little by the crew. They clearly did not get on well with one another and for some this carried over to their dealings with passengers. The PA announcements also seemed overdone with little thought to the timing of some especially when being delivered in three languages. I found the boarding process interesting. Row numbers were called in increments of 5 logically starting from the back. There appeared to be an insistence that the entire gate area was scoured for every last passenger within the designated rows before the next 5 rows were called. I have never seen a 777 boarded so slowly resulting in a 20 minute delay. It looked like the ""rules"" were getting in the way of reasonableness and that overly technical atmosphere summed up the flight. This flight was QF- ticketed and my outbound journey was with QF. I rated them the same overall but for different reasons. Emirates has the hard product in its grasp but I preferred the QF flight for its reassuring professionalism.",2/11/2015,4,4,5,5,3,8
Ahmed Moonis,1,I'm a frequent flyer on SIN-DEL-SIN route. While the in-flight service and the crew have been impeccable the plane quality has deteriorated. Travelled couple of times earlier last year on A330 with quite a lot of leg space (which is good for me considering I'm 6'1'') but they stopped it in between. Now they are back to the Boeing 777 with 3-3 configuration with cramped seats. Taking the night flight out of SIN after a long work day makes the whole journey painful. Plus if its code sharing with Qantas flight from Australia (which they do quite often) the plane becomes cramped up with long lines for toilets. Hope they bring back the A330 on the route.,2/20/2013,4,2,4,4,4,7
A Nicoll,1,Flew on the B787 from Gatwick to Cancun 28/09/14. We pre booked our seats prior to travelling which is something I would highly recommend (although they do charge) as I saw that many couples and families were separated. Both flights were on time and were shorter flying time than past flights to Mexico. The staff were generally good outbound and the food was warm and of a reasonable standard. Drinks were regularly offered (although they are expensive). Entertainment was good outbound. Inbound flight was a little different - as soon as we got onboard we were told that the entertainment system in the rear of the plane seats 30 and up was not working. Staff and pilot apologised and stated that staff were looking to reset the system. I did not work for the first 2 hours and so were offered a complimentary drink. The cabin crew were fantastic and they apologised personally for the inconvenience. Speaking to the cabin crew they stated that this particular aircraft has a fault with the entertainment system. They told us that they had reported it for months but Thomson were not doing anything about it. After just over two hours the system worked for the remainder of the flight but given the plane is brand new and that Thomson make such a big deal about the 787 you'd have thought they would want the planes to be working perfectly. I am happy to pay a premium to know that I am flying on a brand new plane with better facilities particularly long haul. Inbound the food was good staff excellent and the pilot gave regular updates. Overall a good experience on the 787 but Thomson need to sort the fault out on the entertainment system.,10/28/2014,4,4,4,3,5,8

Ahmed Zafar,0,Travelled from IAD to ADD then to LSK on July 1 - absolutely the worst flight segments ever taken. The flight from IAD to ADD was 90 minutes late with no explanation given. Once onboard the plane (777-300ER) smelt foul and it was evident the plane had not had a good cleaning in ages. Being a Star Gold Member you would think preference would be given for upgrades however the lead cabin staff informed me that was not Ethiopians policy. Once airborne the inflight entertainment system was below average. The food and snacks were awful had the airline stated their food was below par I would have bought something at the airport. Finally the communication skills of the cabin crew and even the captain was below average. My return journey was equal if not worse than the first leg. Plane smelt windows in the plane had not been cleaned in ages it took a cabin crew member 1 hour 45 mins to realize my call light was on. I could not move due to the miserable 3-3-3 configuration. Overall I will never use Ethiopian again.,8/18/2014,2,1,1,1,1,NaN
A Huggett,1,SYD-BKK on an A330-300 that was not refurbished yet. While the interior updates are clearly due I thought this was a very good flight. The cabin crew were friendly and helpful. The meal (lunch) ice cream served afterwards and refreshment prior to arrival were great. IFE is dated but adequate and there was a reasonable choice for a 9-hour flight. Seat comfort and legroom was fine. I have flown on Qantas A330 aircraft numerous times so was not expecting a state-of-the-art product. The refurbishment will make this a great aircraft to fly on routes to Asia.,1/30/2015,4,5,4,3,5,8
Altman Nathaniel,0,June 3 EWR-SFO Economy on a new 737-900. We departed two hours late due to a storm and flight crew distributed water and was generally helpful and good humored. These planes offer standard economy seating not as comfortable as other planes United flies. Bathrooms are extremely tiny and cramped. As opposed to a wide variety of seatback entertainment on UA's 757s from JFK to California this new 737-900 offer no entertainment options at all a major disappointment on such a long flight. These planes may be perfect for a 1-2 hour trip but not for a transcontinental journey.,6/4/2014,2,2,2,1,3,2
A Hull,1,Business Class Perth-Brunei-Dubai-Heathrow. Check-in quick and easy apart from the usual slow pass through security followed by a calm wait in the Malaysian Airlines lounge which Royal Brunei use. All flights on schedule. Meals could be ordered on demand were as good or better than we have had on other airlines. The space between seats on the B767 Brunei to London was excellent and reclined sufficiently for reasonable comfort. However we would have liked the leg rests to rise to a more horizontal position. A320 Perth to Brunei was satisfactory. Business Class lounge in the modern Brunei terminal pleasant and offered a range of nibbles and non-alcoholic drinks. We did buy a small bottle of spirits in Perth Duty Free and were supplied with a suitable bottles of soft drink mixers on the plane. And while you can take the remains with you if you dis-embark in Brunei you can't bring it back on. You can purchase Duty Free wine and spirits in Dubai very cheaply and these are allowed back on the plane as are Duty Free purchases in other airports.

Alun Williams,1,My wife and I travelled Business Class on a round trip from London Heathrow via Abu Dhabi to Phuket Thailand in March/April 2015. This was the first time we had used Etihad and we were delighted. Although the food on the outgoing trip was not quite as good as the return leg it was still very good. The meal on the Phuket to Abu Dhabi leg of the return journey was the best we have ever had on an airline and the service could not be faulted! The wine was excellent and included a Grand Cru claret. To top the whole experience off the service from the cabin crew was absolutely superb they could not have been more attentive and helpful. We shall certainly be using Etihad again.,4/8/2015,5,5,5,2,5,9
Ahsan Ali,0,Lahore to Dubai return (A310). My worst experience with PIA. Both times flight was delayed very poor staff onboard. Meals quality was very low nothing for entertainment. Cabin crew offered us head phones but due to technical faults they were not working when they were inserted on seat arm.,3/3/2014,2,2,2,2,3,5
A Nurser,0,UK to Sydney via Shanghai for Christmas/New Year Dec 2011 - this airline was the cheapest. I purchased an Australian Visa with my flight but had to buy a second visa at Heathrow as China Eastern were adamant I didn't have one and would not issue me a boarding pass until I purchased an emergency one for Â£35! I would advise taking your own entertainment as the initial first leg of the trip was the only one with a personal TV system every other flight only had communal TV screens showing Chinese films with English subtitles. Food was mainly meat with noodles or fish with rice you may want to consider becoming vegetarian for the trip. I had an overnight stop over in Shanghai nothing was very co-ordinated at the airport - ensure you have a hotel booking slip from your agent. All stopover passengers from my flight didn't seem to have a reservation at either of the airport's hotels the majority of us ended up paying for our rooms on a credit card.,1/21/2012,2,2,2,1,3,3
Aidan Stradling,0,FRA-HAJ on a BAe 146. Comfortable and pleasant despite being full. This is the high standard that some other airlines should aspire to. Simple effective efficient and quietly professional.,11/13/2007,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,4
Alvaro Orrantia,0,I was flying from Buenos Aires to San Carlos de Barioche on March 28 and LAN announced an 'unanticipated' maintenance work on the plane. This caused a delay of about 90 minutes leaving close to 10pm. There were no vouchers for a snack and ground personnel didn't even know how to use a pay phone to call someone who was going to pick me up. On my way home flying from Buenos Aires to Sao Paulo on April 9 LAN again has an 'unanticipated' maintenance work on the plane.,4/9/2014,1,4,3,2,2,1
A Hutchinson,1,Sydney to Honolulu return. I have really only one complaint because Australia and Perth in particular is so far away the time spent sitting in one spot for over 12-15 hrs is hard enough without the seating and general facilities being less than user friendly. Return flight from Honolulu to Sydney was very cramped (leg room) and there was a lot less overhead baggage space than the flight to Honolulu. This made the experience more uncomfortable than it could have been.,8/27/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,3
Aikman Skorri,0,I was travelling with a group of 16 from Keflavik to London. We had already booked our seats. For some reason Icelandair changed all this without letting us know. We were seated all over the plane. When we approached the staff with our problems there was no will in correcting this - in fact they were very rude. When we finally got to the plane we noticed that most of our original seats were empty. Cabin crew showed the same attitude as the staff at check-in - rude and not willing to do anything for the group. I know that Icelandair has attractive prices - but my advise is stay away!,12/14/2012,1,3,1,2,1,NaN

A Obando,1,"Both flights to Puerto Rico and back were pleasant. On time and services were great. However, on my way back home, I had a back injury that flared up during the trip and the people from Jetblue were great in assisting me with a wheelchair from beginning to end. I will definately recommend them and use their service in the future. ",7/18/2015,5,3,4,4,5,10
A Idris,1,Traveled PER-SIN only. The ground staff were nice enough to ask if I wanted a window seat or aisle seat during check in. Boarding went pretty quickly. The crew were helpful with my carry-on luggage on board. There were some problems with the passenger call bell button and it was quite worrying. (Probably just an old aircraft. The seats looked old and dirty but overall very spacious and comfortable. The cabin seemed warm and stuffy throughout the flight though). Safety and budget transportation was definitely the main focus of the airline. In safety aspects the crew did their seatbelt checks after the turbulence announcement and constantly doing toilet-checks and house-keeping often. Announcements by the crew could be improved in terms of clarity audibility and tone of voice. I did not try the inflight entertainment and purchase any meals. But the menu of the inflight meals and the list of inflight entertainment seemed interesting and a bit on the steep side. However definitely use this airline again because of the price and comfort.,1/20/2014,4,5,0,0,3,7
Alwaleed Althani,1,"The business class seats on both legs of our flight were comfortable but not as good as CX, QA, EK or EY, they were great in the seating position but in laying down they became very narrow around the shoulders. The entertainment system though is far behind all competition and KLM really needs to work on the selection they offer, as for the food - instead of the normal 3 choices other airlines offer, KLM only give 2 but the portions are very generous and the taste is very good. Where KLM excelles is in the service, they make you feel welcome they are warm and serve with professionalism and respect. I will always prefer them for their personal touch.",7/12/2015,5,3,4,3,5,9
A O'Brien,1,Flew from Rio/GIG to CDG last month. Selected the option for a seat plus on the upper deck of the 747-400. This gives you additional leg room and a smaller cabin so in my view worth the extra money. Crew were excellent on this trip friendly and chatty. Food was good. For me the seat became very uncomfortable after 4 hours. I have travelled many times with Air France over the years and the crews can be very hit and miss. This crew were one of the best.,7/4/2013,5,3,5,5,5,8
Aisleyne Moxanne,0,DUB-NAP. Was expecting very poor standards of both safety and comfort from this airline but was surprised. Flight at 5.00 am and the FA's were refreshed and alert. Pre flight safety procedures were clear and as high a standard as any other 3 star airline. The seats were quite hard and leg room was limited but the flight was made pleasant by friendly FA's. In flight catering was poor considering it was a four hour flight. We were handed almost frozen sandwiches and a juice box. Baggage collection was mayhem. All in all the flight was fair and would fly Adria again - but the airline does not compare to other 3 star airlines such as Aer Lingus and KLM.,8/2/2006,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A O'Connor,0,Flew 4 times within a space of 6 days with LAN in Argentina and Chile. The first flight was cancelled and we were only informed on arriving at the airport. The check-in staff were very unhelpful and told us to go to the ticket office in the centre of Puntas Arenas (a 20 minute taxi ride away). The staff there weren't much help either and couldn't find space on an alternative flight so we eventually went by bus (14 hours) the next day. We did get our money back though. Flights 2 and 3 were fine. The food was pretty dire - 3 biscuits one of which contained Ham. Puerto Iguazu to Buenos Aires landed at the wrong airport in BA (not the one that was scheduled. Luckily we didn't have a connecting flight. If you did have a connecting flight then you had too get a taxi which you had to pay for. Overall not a good airline but there isn't a huge selection in Argentina and Chile so you would struggle to avoid it.,11/9/2010,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,2
Alyssa Lew,1,Aircraft took off and landed in Kuala Lumpur on time. Despite being a low-cost carrier Air Asia X provided an excellent inflight service.

A Iregbu,1,New York to London via Reykjavik roundtrip (stopping in Reykjavik for 3 days on the way there). Friendly staff fluent. Very competitive prices as the same flight on a US airline was $400 more - without a stop in Iceland. Cannot complain about paying for food on flights as the flight was cheap but it did look better than most airline food I've seen. Would definitely recommend flying transatlantic with them and stopping in Iceland.,7/31/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
AJ Jeffery,0,I have had a good experience with Delta so I chose to fly it again. We were flying from Philadelphia to Austin Texas. First off my flight was delayed for an hour and a half.

Our flight left Philadelpiha at 6am CST and got to Austin at 7pm CST. I will never fly Delta again.,9/9/2014,1,2,4,1,4,1
Amanda Alderete,0,Flight was switch around twice. First was delay the flight 7 hrs then the early fight I had at 7am was pushed back 3hrs with no phone call.

A Ohara,1,About a 3 hour flight from Guangzhou to Yangon and back. Outbound flight was delayed by more than an hour with no explanation or apology (as I remember). A friend who regularly flies with MAI on that route told me Guangzhou airport delays MAI every time in favour of Chinese airlines. No delay on the return route. Crew's English varied from very poor to very good but were all very friendly. No inflight entertainment but I would fly MAI again largely thanks to the friendly crew and the convenient flight times on that route.,2/5/2014,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,7

Amanda Brown,1,Tuesday 11th June Christchurch to Melbourne on the 6.05 am flight. Boarding was a mish mash and those boarding last found the overhead lockers full. Carry on bags checked at gate for weight. FA's friendly and served with a smile. Frequent water runs during the flight. Again the A320 is cramped and you hope that the person in front of you doesn't put their seat back into the little space you have. Ok for a short over the Tasman Sea.,6/10/2013,4,4,0,0,4,8
A J Bastien,1,Oct 20 2012. Second flight on Atlasjet this time from AYT to IST. Flight delayed half an hour but still made my IST to CDG connection. No hidden fees. Did not charge a fee to check two bags or for two carry on items. FAs attentive and courteous complimentary sandwich on a one-hour flight. The seat in front of me didn't have a pocket in which to store my paperback and glasses and I could not select my seat in advance had to check in 24 hours prior to boarding. Other than these two complaints Atlasjet is in my opinion excellent value.,11/1/2012,5,2,3,0,4,8
Ake Sjostedt,1,Being disabled check-in was quick and easy with help from staff. I got a whole row A-C for myself. I was allowed to keep my walker to the aircraft entrance.

A Ohr,0,After defunct Mexicana left us high and dry in Havana the staff at Cubana was helpful. They had the next flight to Cancun 5 hours after our canceled Mexicana flight and told us while it was booked there would probably be room for us. Come back in 2 hours. One and half hours later they tracked us down in another part of the airport and practically held our hand taking us from purchase to check-in. However then the bad news. The flight was delayed about 45 minutes before takeoff for unknown reasons forcing us to miss our United flight in Cancun (to Denver) and stranding us for two days due to a Labor Day crush in Cancun. And when I saw a wooden floor the first thing when I walked onto the plane and then the exit sign in Russian I was skeptical. And I've seen better overhead bins on city buses. At times I thought it would be my last flight ever but the rubber bands held together and somehow the plane made it.,9/9/2010,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,2
Amanda Emmell,1,"I broke my foot on my vacation and the entire flight staff were amazing. The cabin staff were very accommodating and helpful.

Flying Business class the check in was smooth and friendly the staff helped me to check my luggage directly to Reykjavik Iceland although my connecting flight was on Icelandair and on a Separate ticket. Boarding was good and quick but the crew in the business class cabin were mostly grumpy with no traces of a smile for the whole trip.

Luckily I was flying SAGA class and I stood for half an hour only. Business class Lounge at CDG 1 is worthless. Flight from CDG-KEF was good and comfortable the crew were friendly and hospitable. Food was very good entertainment excellent seats of old version but comfortable enough. KEF Airport arrival hall is a big mess with only 3 belts for almost 8 arrivals at the same time so you wait around 20 min. A huge supermarket is located in the Arrival area. KEF-IAD. Check in was fast and smooth with no problems SAGA class lounge was excellent food and drinks were both fine. Flight was comfortable and crew were nice.

I do understand planes can be diverted and I really do not have a problem with that. What I do not understand is how a company as Alitalia has such bad service (actually no service) in such cases.â€¦Nothing was arranged in Malepnsa nobody knew what is happening and the most shocking fact is when you find one of Alitalia's ground staff they turn around and tell you: I am going home! In this whole story none of Alitalia's staff said sorry once. The most disorganized airline!,8/27/2013,1,3,1,0,1,NaN

Ameil Paul,1,"Flew London Heathrow - Cologne Bonn on Monday 8th September. Had checked in online and printed my boarding card 2 days before but as I had a suitcase to go in the hold I still needed to queue at the baggage drop-off point/check in desk. Flight left on time and was smooth throughout. The plane seemed new and was clean. My fare included a snack (choice of cheese or ham roll) a small packet with 3 boiled sweets (not quite sure why) and a small bottle of water. I chose the cheese sandwich which was ""ok but could be better"". After the complimentary snack service the crew came round offering hot and cold drinks - including alcoholic drinks - although not sure if any of these were complimentary. We landed 1 hour after departure from Heathrow slightly less time than advertised. I have scored the in-flight entertainment a 1 purely because being a short flight there wasn't any and the website won't allow me to submit my review without a score.

A Pahmadi,0,Customer Service is a 0. Two weeks ahead of a long planned trip they made a schedule change that only gave us 45 minutes in Seoul to make our connection to Bali. This not being allowed by them they wanted to put us on a much later flight that would have caused us to miss a day in Bali. After 3 days (9 hours documented) with the agent and Korean Air they basically would not move our tickets up because they would have to upgrade a 50 minute flight segment to first class because there was only one economy seat left. They take the requirement literally that all they have to do is put you on the next available flight with no consideration for your needs. We had to take a refund pay $700 more and we are not even sure we are on the same flight because they advertised two flights at almost the same time on the same plane. Having traveled I have never been treated so poorly.,5/19/2013,1,0,0,0,1,NaN
Akshay Dholakia,1,As a frequent flier between Bombay-Brussels (I held a platinum card till recently) I have noticed that service is slipping a bit of late.

A Jane,1,SYD-CGK in Business Class. New planes with comfortable business cabin in 2-2-2 lay out with lie flat beds. Day flight from Sydney included 6 course lunch all served with full linen service and understated friendliness. IFE not up to the leaders but adequate for the 8 hours. On board immigration a stand out - pays huge dividends on arrival into Jakarta. Return overnight flight rated slightly lower but still very nice. Service was also more about getting everyone bedded down rather than serving a gourmet feast but that is fair enough. Breakfast prior to landing simple but tasty.,8/21/2012,5,5,5,4,5,8

It was expensive and I thought that the flights would be full nevertheless the flight to LHR was at 65% and the return at 85%. Inflight catering its a joke. Frozen pasta and a very small salad. No water service on 3.5 hour flight. The crew are very efficient but there is no interaction all you see is frozen smiles. Baggage delivery takes a life in LHR and half a life in ATH. Both flights well ahead of time but what's the point if you wait 45 minutes for your luggage? Big problem is that BA has almost the same problems and there is no third alternative on ATH-LHR route.,5/30/2012,2,4,1,4,4,4
Al Diaz,0,I arrived to the airport 2 hours and 45 minutes before my scheduled departure time. I was told that there was a 3 hour mandatory check in time. The agents involved did not want to hear about my issues on my way to the airport. I was told that especially on Sundays flights are full up and my seat was sold to another customer. I had no bags to check in and I had to pay a hefty fine to re-schedule my flight to another day. For all those unfamiliar with the DF airport it takes 10 minutes to go through security and another 5 to walk to the gates. Most flights are not even given a gate number until 1 hour before the scheduled departure time. This was my fist and last time flying with Aeromexico.,8/7/2013,3,3,4,3,1,NaN
A Jarrett,1,Of all my recent experiences flying LHR-MEL I would consider Royal Brunei to be the best. The cabin crew were genuine and attentive and being there for passengers was their primary focus throughout the flight. A big selling point was the additional seat pitch giving a sense of space and comfort. The recline was good. The entertainment system worked perfectly well. Meals were of similar quality to other carriers however were a little more generous than the offerings of some others and a lot more generous than those offered by BA and VS. Check in was simple and efficient in both directions and travelling through Brunei Airport was a joy. Small quiet no ridiculous long distances to navigate and not daunting in any way. I also prefer having two stops (3 x 7hr legs) between the UK and Australia as being in the air for 14 hours on the now standard 1x7 + 1x14 hour leg is nothing short of horrific. I would choose Royal Brunei on this route over all others.,6/19/2013,5,5,5,4,5,10
Amin Mayur,1,Flew Fresno - Phoenix - Orlando 3 day trip. Last month flew Fresno - Phoenix - Charlotte. Last trip was a nightmare because of delays - mechanical resulting in missed flights and a flight crew on the last leg that seemed to not be too concerned with the delay given it was late at night. Anyway booked again. This time first class. Good experience. First leg out operated by Sky West. Flight attendants - two of them talking loudly all the time. Were attentive to passenger needs. Hopefully will be more sensitive given that some of us had been up since 4 am to get ready for the flight. Rest of the trip was great. Bottom line flight crew is key to a positive experience.

A Par,0,I travelled with Thomas Cook on the 12th October from Newcastle to Tenerife flight time 0930. I decided to travel with Thomas Cook as it is a well known popular company and it's fair to say I will never travel with them again! The seats were uncomfortable - the leg room was poor. I asked for an extended seatbelt quietly as I was embarrassed but the cabin crew was not so quiet about it! The cabin crew going to Tenerife were not customer friendly. I overheard them moaning to each other about passengers needing the toilet. However the flight home on the 19th October at 1530 had lovely cabin crew who were so friendly and very good with the passengers. Also found that the aircraft were dirty in general. On balance I would never travel with Thomas Cook again was so disappointed with the at the start of my holiday! I think staff need extra customer service training.,11/3/2014,1,1,2,1,0,NaN

A Parnell,0,Flight from Nottingham East Midlands to Cancun on 30th July 2014 aircraft type - 787 Dreamliner. Took off 40 min late due to issues with catering and inflight entertainment. Inflight entertainment intermittent and then reduced capability. At 3 hours out (Mid Atlantic) pilot announces technical issue with aircraft problem with hydraulics and that we need to return to Manchester to have replacement parts fitted. Upon arrival no crew available to enable replacement aircraft to be used. We ended up in a local hotel overnight with a replacement flight on an old 767 at 09:30 next morning. Eventually arrived almost 23 hours late great start to a much needed holiday! I understand that technical issues do occur but the turn back apperars to have been solely based on a commercial decision by TUI to avoid having an aircraft on ground in Cancun. 787 is a great aircraft when it works however there are too many problems with it currently. Avoid until fixed properly.,8/20/2014,3,3,3,3,4,3

Finally got our bags the night we were leaving. The airline is very disorganized. The seats and leg space are small. The food is terrible.,7/8/2013,1,1,1,3,1,NaN
Alain Kupferman,1,Flew from Bangkok to Siam Reap on ATR72. Good snack for such a short flight friendly crew very low prices (much lower than the airport taxes) clean planes all on time with arrival ahead of schedule to be recommended.,9/22/2013,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
A Jhunjhunwala,1,Johannesburg - Lubumbashi return in Economy class. Plane was B737-300. Flights on time and almost empty on outbound leg. Requested vegetarian meal and had to show ticket confirmation to get it from surprised flight purser. Meal was served cold and did not taste good. Even though it is a short trip of around 2.5 hours the ticket fare is exorbitant - more than USD 900! There is no inflight entertainment.,8/16/2012,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,3
A Patel,1,After booking with Norwegian from Gatwick to Fort Lauderdale via Copenhagen I was very pleased about the price we paid but the reviews on this airline were so bad I was actually very worried however what I found from booking my ticket to checking in to flying and arriving at destination an absolute wonderful experience. The Dreamliner was fantastic sensored dimming windows USB ports on screen and mains power point under every seat. There are more on board facilities than other scheduled airlines. Seats were comfortable and we had enough legroom. My husband and son are tall so had aisle seats. We had no food on board as wanted to keep the cost down but that was fine. Overall the experience was great and one if the best things was the multiple device charging points on each seat that's what did it my kids!,9/17/2014,4,5,0,4,4,10
Amna Shafqat,1,Flew to London from Lahore. This trip to London was very enjoyable. The cabin crew was very helpful the aircraft was a 777-er and the food served was excellent. Blankets and pillows were handed out when needed. Even though the seat covers were torn here and there yet the comfort was there. Recommended.,4/18/2013,4,4,4,3,4,8
A Johansson,0,Hong Kong to Helsinki in business class on A340. Dinner service was very slow. It took more than an hour before service even started. There were not enough staff to serve drinks and food together and refill of drinks were not offered until dinner was over. Most airlines give you some toiletries in business class but there was nothing like that on this flight. The lavatories had soap but that was it. No lotion toothbrushes or any other essentials. Like many reviewers said plane was old and tarnished. Seats are not flat in business; and still the seats were the best part of this flight.,5/6/2013,1,3,1,0,1,NaN
Alain Van,0,Flew TP0614 from LIS to BRU in Business on 30 Aug. Never again! You pay Business but TAP puts the overbooked economy passengers into Business with the consequence that you do not have free space between the seats. No possibility to work. Meal consists of sandwich with cheese and ham. There is no reason to fly TAP in business.,9/3/2012,1,3,1,2,4,2
Amy Billings,1,"My husband and I were very skeptical after reading the negative reviews regarding Spirit, but unfortunately, money was an issue getting to our destination, so we bit our lip and tried them. To our very pleasant surprise we were very satisfied. The negative reviews seem to complain about the space, the cost for extras and flight delays. A soda or water is expensive, so plan ahead. I can tell you that the information you get from Spirit is spot on. If your bag is overweight, you have to pay more. You can only take one personal item on the plane. Yes, you have to pay for food, drink, a roomier seat. But-that is spelled out before you purchase the tickets. We did buy the zone 2 seating, and it was worth it. The seats are regular sized seats, but the knee room is a bit cramped. Nothing that was too bad, but I felt bad for a gentleman that was quite tall that had to put his knees in the isle. But he was happy and said he had flown with them many times before. I brought a neck pillow to sit on and found that very very helpful. A few snack and water in my backpack, along with my Kindle and earbuds and I was set! The plane itself was spotless and the airline attendants were kind and helpful. I certainly would not hesitate to fly Spirit again.",7/11/2015,5,3,NaN,NaN,5,8
Alan Bone,1,This is my second time return from SYD to AKL in Business on LAN. I have to say that this airline is superb. Cabin Crew are the best friendly and helpful. Always a smile! Food service is excellent. I have always been a Qantas and Emirates customer but now will choose LAN when flying to NZ wish they went on to Europe. Only draw back is the departure out of AKL at 6am but the high standard of the air crew is worth it.,12/29/2013,5,5,5,5,5,10
A Johnson,1,Tianjin to Shanghai Hongqi. The flight and service itself was comparable to an Australian domestic flight but what really impressed me was the effort and communication provided by the Captain given the excessive delays that appear to be common place around Beijing airspace.,6/16/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Pathak,1,IAH-BWI. B737-900. Inflight entertainment was good. They have Direct TV installed and stream live programs. Its costly though. Food and drinks were pretty much standard. Flight took off and landed on time.,9/24/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
A Paull,0,TLV-JFK. Flight was overbooked and denied boarding even though we were on a tour. I understand this is a common occurrence and that Israelis are given preference over residence of other countries. El Al wanted to place us on standby even though there were seats in business and 1st class. EL AL wanted to place us on the 600am flight from TLV to Barcelona with transfer to AA plane to JFK. So instead of arriving 600am we would arrive 300pm with no sleep. Not acceptable. Wanted to purchase 1st class ticket EL Al did not want to sell. Finally convinced El AL to sell me the 1st class tickets. Once I became a paying passenger I guess a group ticket does not count as a paying passenger attitudes change and El AL became friendly. Flight was pleasant lots of space seats folded flat FA attentive. Unless you fly business or 1st class cannot recommend this airline.,3/23/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,3
Amy Brokaw,0,We got a package deal to Vegas from Kansas City to get married. The price was right in the beginning. We checked in only to find out the normal sized carry on was too big for this particular airline! We flew with a group so it was interesting to see the inconsistency of prices. Our bag was $55 another $50 another $45. The plane itself was fine. Smaller seats less leg room but the good news is you can get in the luggage rack if need be for all of the empty space! Both flight to and from our destination were late with no apparent explanation. We did receive an email stating our flight was delayed however you get there in a timely manner only to hear horror stories of how people's flights are canceled for no reason with no refunds or my favorite people receiving an email of a delay to find the flight was on time so they missed it resulting in them having to purchase another ticket! No snacks or drink provided. Without a doubt the worst airline ever! Never again!,5/13/2015,1,1,1,1,2,1
Alan Brown,0,MAN-AMS 19 April. Flight departed MAN almost 2 hours late due to late inbound arrival should have had 2.5 hrs to connect at AMS but by the time we deplaned had just 40 minutes to get from one end of Schipol to the other. My onward flight had already boarded but was waiting for the 3 passengers from the MAN delayed flight  otherwise it would have meant staying in AMS overnight. Food on board was awful (a piece of cake and a very weak coffee).,4/21/2013,1,1,1,1,2,1
A Peckham,1,GMP-PUS-GMP. Very good fast efficient and friendly staff. At GMP ground handling done by Asiana so all the traditional quirks of this great airlines. Served water and OJ on this very short flight.,6/30/2009,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,10
Amy Osullivan,0,There has been consistent daily delays to Molokai. I have waited in the commuter terminal for 3-4 hours to get on a 15 minute flight to Molokai. I see that the same aircraft is going back and forth between Honolulu Lihue and Lanai and Kapalua but when the delays piggyback the Molokai flight will be pushed back to accommodate the passengers on later flights to other destinations. Customer service podium is empty with no notification of delay until you look at the flight board. We can see the customer service personnel on the ramp laughing and chatting with co-workers they show no concern for all the passengers in the terminal waiting for someone to come in. When you finally get a hold of someone and ask them what's the delay they say its due to the late arrival of the aircraft. We were delayed 3 times because management changed their mind on where the plane should go. It was announced that when our aircraft comes from Lihue it will continue on to Molokai however when the plane lands they change their mind and inform us its going to Lanai on time. This causes us to be pushed back 2 more hours. Don't get on the new planes they cant land on Molokai and Lanai with more than half a load of passengers. It takes 3 times longer to board and unload. I don't recommend Island Air.,5/22/2013,0,0,0,0,0,NaN
Alan Clare,0,London - Sao Paolo flight change in Madrid. Departed London late as needed to take off missing passengers luggage. Pay as you eat 'Tu Menu' service served courteously. Boarding went quite well at Madrid but delayed departure due to taking off more missing passengers luggage. From Madrid meal was a good example of airline food and the wine was agreeable. Crew delighted to offer me a second wine. This was a modern Airbus but no individual television screens two dated films shown along with was an interesting Iberia magazine programme. Surprised that staff did make 2 rounds giving out water and chocolate biscuits during the flight. Good attention to use of seat belts through turbulence and announcements in English clear. Wash rooms do not appear to get sufficient if any attention during this 10 hour flight and became rather smelly. Sao Paolo - London. On departure the plane was clean and pleasant smelling. Cabin crew greeted passengers with a mixture of surly indifference and pleasant smiles but didn't see much in the way of assistance to find seats or storing hand luggage. Meal good but I made the mistake of asking for an additional wine! The reply came 'I am very busy collecting. If you want more wine wait until we are finished and come to the back of the plane'. This time one reasonably recent film. Again wash rooms became smelly and lacked attention during the flight. This was 24th December and the crew could not have been less festive. Madrid - London was code share with BA and what a contrast to the Iberia leg.,1/8/2013,3,3,4,1,2,2
A Pedersen,1,HAN-WAW Boeing 767-300ER. Check in no problem with severely oversized luggage. Severely overbooked I was upgraded - later downgraded as the 10 last rows were mistakingly not available by check in staff â€“ so eventually there was a lot of space. However I was offered a seat in business if I would accept economy class food. I accepted and was put behind the 5 true paying business-class passengers but enjoyed the advanced seat and space. Seat easy to maneuvre. IFE not working except for flight tracking. Staff attentive but a bit like robots no smiles and got a feeling of being alienated. Was offered two meal options in economy food tried both. Food tolerable.,12/28/2011,5,3,3,1,4,7
A Pernett,1,BAQ-MEX. With one stop in BOG to change planes. A319 from Barranquilla (BAQ) to BogotÃ¡ (BOG). Quick flight nice service only beverages in that short flight. Arrived to BogotÃ¡ Puente AÃ©reo is a chaos. Connecting flight on time. Long queue in emigration but not so annoying. Staff friendly on gate. Inflight service attentive and nice. Lunch was delicious with a good selection of beverages and coffee. The only drawback was IFE not good sound. Seats must improve for a flight of 4 hours. Will use them again.,10/30/2012,4,4,5,3,4,8
Ana Colta,1,In August this year we flew from Amsterdam to Tbilisi Georgia and back from Yerevan Armenia to Amsterdam. Flight to Tbilisi was just ok departed on time we knew there was no food served on short haul flights so we were prepared. When we checked in for the flight from Yerevan to Kiev we were told that there was no possibility of sitting next to each other which was quite disappointing. However during the last minutes prior boarding we were called to the boarding desk separately and got new boarding passes - in business class. Not just for seats but for all services as well!,12/18/2014,5,5,4,3,5,9
Alan Coles,1,May 26th Vancouver to Calgary. Good assistance at check in friendly staff. On time departure comfortable plane. Only gripe is we were not seated together. It would have cost $45 to change seats being a short flight we did not. On May 29th we flew Calgary to Los Angeles. Not seated together at check in our seats were changed free of charge by the friendly check in staff member. Flight departed on time good friendly cabin crew. Good clean plane. Lost TV about 2 hours on American side of border but you can not blame Westjet for that. We would fly Westjet again.,6/9/2013,4,4,4,4,5,10
Ana Vetere Arellano,1,LH457: I was quite satisfied with this flight. Stewards and stewardesses were friendly food was of good quality and entertainment offered was very good. My 5 year old daughter enjoyed the cartoons. I would suggest that if seats are available travellers with children could be positioned in the plane so that they can be given an extra seat so the child can sleep better. Of course if the flight is full I understand that this is not at all feasible.,1/9/2014,4,3,4,4,5,8
A Peter,0,Flew from Toronto to Bucharest via Vienna and back. Their food was awful I had never seen such tiny portions of food. Although decent the food was much too small. On the leg from Vienna to Bucharest they only served us one small slice of a waffle (hardly recognizable as one). Two drinks had been offered. When flying Tarom from VIE to Bucharest it was much better in terms of services timing and seating comfort. Will not fly Austrian anymore.,7/16/2013,1,2,1,3,2,2
Alan Damian,1,Brussels - Newark. I chose Jet Airways solely for the price of the ticket and was pleasantly surprised. Flights were on time. Staff nice attentive and helpful. Food was great (curry). Unlike US Airways that I had flown two weeks before JA plane had individual screens for watching movies. I would definitely recommend or fly again.,11/10/2013,5,5,4,4,5,8
A Johnson,1,LHR-EWR in 777 economy. Was pleasantly surprised by the whole experience as was expecting something a lot worse! Plane spotlessly clean and well maintained. Relatively low load so had 3 seats between 2 of us so a bit of extra room. Service was reasonable; crew performed what they had to do but not a lot more. Food ok and drinks priced as you would expect for alcohol. Inbound was pretty much the same; very low load so had whole row to myself. IFE was good. Food was good. Crew again performed what they had to do but American based crew really don't want to go out of their way unless they have to. Overall I was pleased with the flights and would consider them again for a trip to the US.,2/1/2012,4,4,3,3,3,7
Anand Nair,0,"I recently flew Kochi - Dubai - Kochi. I had a very interesting experience on the return leg. During lunch service I asked for a Beer. I was served a warm flat can of beer that was lousy. I waited patiently until the stewardess came around for the 2nd round and requested a vodka. The reply given to me was ""No. I cant serve you a Vodka because you had earlier asked for a Beer"". I told them that the beer was warm and flat to which the solution offered was ""I will serve it with Ice"". When asked why this stupid rule the answer was ""This is company policy Sir"". I refused their beer. Thank you Jet Airways for the lousy flights you operate with no entertainment cramped seats et al this is really the icing on the cake. Lousy attitude.",5/20/2015,2,1,3,1,3,2
Alan Dinnie-Weall,0,Our planned trip from Gatwick to Florida for next May has (I understand others as well) already been cancelled due a short-fall in passenger numbers! It is very rare for me to have a holiday let alone fly. I have been told by friends that they have never heard of this situation before seven months before the planned flights. I have been told due to lack of demand but am worried why so far ahead.,10/23/2013,5,3,3,3,3,5
A Johnson,0,I was denied my seat by the ticket agents. I arrived as instructed over an hour before the flight (ATL-LAS). When I went to check in at the kiosk a ticket agent explicitly told me to stop and stand in a different line. Once the agents finished texting and chatting with each other they finally got to me - only to declare that I'd missed check-in. When I protested that I'd been standing in line the whole time waiting for them they said I should have checked in via a kiosk. I replied that I had been checking in until they told me to stop and get in another line. Then they offered to rebook me on a flight leaving 2 days later. The whole time I was at the ticket counter the other agents were busy taking complaints from other customers.,5/5/2014,1,0,0,0,1,NaN
A Petersen,1,CPH-ZRH-PMI-ZRH in C class. Very impressed with Edelweiss in general. Nice clean aircraft and lovely and attentive crews. From PMI we were Lucky than Edelweiss changed the aircraft to their brand new A330-300 long haul aircraft I guess to familiarise crew with the new aircraft. Food was nice and well presented on all trips and all flights on time.,7/1/2014,4,5,4,4,4,9
Anatoli Chernyaev,0,"The staff lacked knowledge of the English language and basic knowledge of ethics. Being on a transit flight first, I had to move quickly to get out to my respective gate but the staff would not regulate the traffic of passengers leaving the plane, thus, making me be late and managing to board for the last minute. At my final destination, my buggage was lost and no one could answer me properly what the reason was. You had to buy food on the plane if you needed something and nothing was included in the price of the ticket. Flying for more than 4 hours for both flights, having nothing to eat, being treated awfully, losing the luggage made this the worst experience I have had.",7/18/2015,1,1,1,1,1,2
Alan Duffy,1,IAD-ORY return in BizSeat. I disagree with comments about the BizSeat being Premium Economy rather than Business Class. BizSeat is equivalent to the business class seats that airlines used to use on transatlantic seats prior to the introduction of flat beds in the last few years. The seat is very comfortable and uses old manual controls reclines to a 140 degree angle. The best thing about the layout of the 757 currently used on the Dulles route is that there are just 40 seats in the BizSeat cabin and 24 in the BizBed cabin meaning 64 passengers. BA Lounge at Dulles is great while the Salon Icare lounge at Orly is nothing to write home about. Service on the flight to ORY was poor especially considering that there were only 25 passengers on board and 5 flight attendants. Service on the return from ORY with a full plane was much better. The one downfall certainly in the BizSeat cabin is the food and beverage service. While there are some great wines available liquor selection is very limited. The main meals are nouvelle cuisine so while tasty are not very filling. I was shocked that OpenSkies don't provide a menu card to preview meal options. The breakfast on the outbound and snack on the return flight were below the standard I've seen in any transatlantic economy cabin. Passing through the BizBed cabin it looks like a very poor product compared with parent company BA's Club World and not worth the money. I'd strongly recommend OpenSkies BizSeat for anybody looking for a very affordable halfway point between Premium Economy and a lie-flat bed but the small number of people on board makes the biggest difference.,7/1/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Johnston,0,Very frustrating experience with US Air when flying to Glasgow last week. Our traveling parties were meeting in PHL to connect to the same transatlantic flight. Both flights delayed due to weather but they go in to PHL at around the same time. Our flight then sat out on the tarmac for 1.5 hrs because they didn't have a gate for us. While we were stuck out there the captain kept saying all flights out were grounded so we would make our connections but that wasn't true as mine left leaving me stranded. Next flight waited for passengers to come in from a delayed flight. Why couldn't they do that for me? I finally made it to Glasgow the next day via London but missed the first day of vacation. On the way back our flight was delayed 2 hours due to maintenance and the next one was as well. On top of all this the staff were rude pushy and the flight attendants were surly the meals were gross and the TV sound did not work throughout so that was 7 hours with nothing to watch. They also kept running out of drinks and food by the time they reached our seats. If I can help it I will never fly US Air again!,7/24/2013,1,3,2,0,1,NaN
A Petersen,1,"CPH-ORD-CPH June 2013. Picked some excellent value tickets on recent SAS promo. Both flights on time in fact we left a little early on the return trip.

Anders P Pedersen,1,HAN-SVO-VIE return. All flights on time. Separate check-in for business class disturbed by allowing economy class pax using the biz-class check-in counter. However correct check in though a bit stressful as the airport and particularly the flight to Moscow was crowded. Flight HAN-SVO overbooked and roughly 20 of 34 seats in business were economy pax being upgraded to business. FA managed to accommodate all additional pax. Access to lounges in HAN SVO and VIE went smoothly. Invitation cards issues at check in and at transfer desk in SVO. In SVO you are free to choose which of 4-5 Aeroflot lounges you want access to. FA staff polite at a first glance a bit too firm and not truly kind. Seats are good. The lie flat on A330-300 is a bit angled but sleep-able. Food present in good quantities and good though not sophisticated. Drinks are good. Champagne/juice offered 2-3 times at take-off. Disappointment is that after departure and until you get any drink they go and take orders which complicate things and the serving of the first drinks happens only 1.5-2 hours after departure. No drink wagons everything is brought by hand to individuals. Food is good a bit tasteless 3 options. Refills or modifications are made possible. FA-English skills very poor. Entertainment acceptable but earphones are collected an hour prior to landing. Altogether a bit rough and robust service but no major faults apart for very slow 1st service on board. Good value for money if you buy discounted biz- class. 3 of 4 flights on time only the last flight was delayed due to snowstorm in Moscow.,3/20/2013,4,3,4,4,4,7
A Jones,1,I flew Comfort Class from IST to JFK. I've always been impressed with the service on economy class Turkish Airlines so I spent the upgrade for Comfort. I'd compare the legroom and quality of service to domestic American Airlines Business Class. It's nearly business class levels of comfort for about 20% more than economy would've cost me. The food was excellent I appreciate being given choices for my meals and drinks as well as having porcelain dishware. The entertainment selection is one of the best I've had on an airline. I first flew Turkish about 2 years ago simply because it was the cheapest option. After experiencing such great service I only fly them when I'm headed to Eastern Europe/ Middle East.,3/17/2015,5,5,5,4,5,9
Alan Ford,0,Singapore to Auckland SQ281 777-200. Can't believe Singapore still use this aircraft it desperately needs an overhaul tiny 6 inch displays no touch even with full brightness I was struggling switched to using my tablet instead.

A Pharmy,1,I travelled on a flight to Incheon in early May 2013 and the service from the ground level to the in flight service was efficient. The flight was on time on both routes to and fro and the waiting time for check-in luggage was relatively quick. The upgrade to the empty seat option was also good and surprisingly a comfortable option that allowed me to sleep on the flight without experiencing any body aches. Would recommend it to passengers travelling on long distance flights.,5/20/2013,5,5,0,0,3,9
Anders Pedersen,1,SIN-CNX-SIN. Good value for money. New A320-200 both ways. All flights on time. Aircraft clean spacious. Load only 50%. No IFE. FA inexperienced fairly professional but without personality. Food purchased in advance was very disappointing (both ways) and just in foil with a spoon absolutely nothing else not even salt. Food expensive for nothing. Biggest minus is the hassle with transfers where one has to vacate and re- enter the airport to sort baggage custom and immigrations for onwards travels. The airline tolerates mostly 2 pieces of hand-luggage. Inscribed luggage charged overweight if more than 1-2 kg. When purchase ticket one has to be careful not to be trapped purchasing expensive seating and superfluous insurance.,1/26/2012,4,4,1,0,4,6

A Jose,0,I've flown Jetblue twice the first one was a good experience with no delays snacks beverages and nice crew. The second one was terrible: our flight JFK-FLL was at 6am and we got to the airport at 1am the screens showed that our flight was cancelled and we waited until 3.30am to receive any attention from JetBlue staff. They said that we would need to wait until tomorrow for another flight or we would need to go to LaGuardia Airport to take another flight in 2 hours offered no accommodation transportation to LGA or vouchers. We had to take a taxi from JFK to LGA. Fortunately we got our flight on time from LGA to FLL but we are really disappointed with this drawback. I think this is the last time we will fly Jetblue.,7/20/2014,4,4,2,3,2,5
A Phillips,0,Business Class LHR-Alicante-Madrid. Do not consider 3 seats being used for 2 people as Business Class. Very good BC lounge. Unable to check in online for return journey. At Madrid again used the lounge and did some shopping. Our boarding cards which show priority and clearly seating in BC shows boarding ends 10 minutes before departure. We arrived at the gate 15 minutes before departure and were told the gate had closed and we would not be allowed to board. Had a very officious supervisor who was not going to budge and insisted the gate closed 15 minutes before departure. She would not agree with what was printed on our boarding card and said that it was wrong. Eventually someone must have said something sensible to her because she finally caved in and allowed us to board. She would not however stop arguing - even when we were walking down the finger to get on the aircraft. To add insult to injury we sat on the aircraft for 10 minutes before 2 female passengers with a child boarded and went through to the economy area. Priority on our boarding card was obviously lost on that member of staff.,8/18/2013,2,3,3,0,4,5
Alan Harlow,1,Flew with my family on PG 242 from Chiang Mai to Koh Samui. Check in at CNX was very efficient and was done in less than 10 minutes. Bangkok Airways also have a small but very good lounge in CNX for economy class passengers which has snacks drinks and free wi-fi. 10 minutes before boarding 2 members of staff came around stamping boarding passes and boarding was also done in zones which I find quicker. Settled into our seats and discovered we were on one of PG's older planes but despite this the plane was in excellent condition. 30 minutes after departure the cabin crew came around with hot meals on this flight Chicken Noodles were served cold drinks tea and coffee were also served and beer was sold. After a flying time of 1.5 hrs we arrived in Koh Samui Airport which is an excellent little airport we were the last people off the plane and when we arrived at baggage claim our bags were already out and within 10 minutes we were at the car rental desk. Overall a very good first experience with Bangkok Airways.,11/9/2012,5,4,4,0,5,8
Anders Pedersen,1,NBO-DXB-SGN on 20-21 July 2014. Travels on Boeings 777-300 and 777-200 respectively. Flights on time. Wonderful service from ground staff throughout. Smooth hotel stay (all inclusive) provided and perfectly arranged by EK in DXB due to long transfer. I was only dissatisfied in DXB with a 40 minutes bus ride from aircraft to gate in the middle of the night - unbelievable and extremely tiring. On board: FAs of superior kindness alertness and professionalism. IFE outstanding. Food: Special meal provided. Other passengers were provided with three options all of acceptable quality. Many soft drinks available. 3 options for beers but all industrial waterish and with a boring taste. Wines tolerable there were 2 red wines in mini bottles and 1 white-wine. DXB-SGN was another tiresome new bus ride for 45 Minutes (including a stop for 20 minutes standing as planes were taxiing. Economy cabin was completely full. Food even better than on the previous flight including special meal. Drinks very generous. Staff did well despite a very crowded economy cabin. Too many seats squeezed in (3-4-3 configuration) which make extremely narrow aisles which hardly can accommodate a trolley. Compared to Qatar Airways Emirates appear to be regaining the lead as (apart from DXB bus experience) they are overall more professional even to customers without status cards.,7/22/2014,5,3,4,4,5,8
A Joven,1,I flew SYD-BKK in Sep 2014. This was my first time flying Emirates though certainly not my first time flying. I've flown quite a few of the greats (ie Cathay Singapore Malaysian Qantas etc) but Emirates completely impressed me. I flew economy and the furnishings and ambience felt and looked better than most economy cabins I've been in. The service was fantastic. Friendly and fast. Not to mention the flight attendants were immaculately groomed well-presented and spoken and quite attractive (male and female). Their overall demeanour was professional friendly and classy. This is in stark contrast to other airlines (ahem Qantas) whose cabin crew look and act like they'd rather be elsewhere.

A Pieta,0,I traveled from Mexico Cancun on July 16 2014. Myself and my daughter had to check out of our hotel room at noon. Our flight back to Toronto WG 514 was supposed to be at 20.10 and pick up from the hotel at 16.45. When we went around 16.20 to check on our pick up bus to the airport we noticed the Flight Alert and delay from 20.10 to 23.59. In the addition on the alert notice was a mistake to the flight number and original time - mistake from the Sunwing representative. Anyway we were picked up at 20.35 and driven to the airport. Our flight did not leave at midnight what was already 4 hrs of delay we left around 1 am. On the plane we were told that the flight crew was not to blame for this delay that Sunwing is responsible for not scheduling our pick up from Cancun. The flight crew were working on their days off to get us to Toronto. Picking up the luggage took over an hour. The conveyer delivered a few suitcases and as we found out after a few travelers started to get very annoyed tired some with small children the conveyer jammed. They brought the rest of bags on the carts. The whole time in Cancun was very relaxing but the trip back drained all of it out of us. It was my first time using Sunwing next time I will try to avoid them.,7/27/2014,4,2,1,2,3,3
Alan Hume,0,"Rex has ditched its MEL-CBR run and has given notice that it will soon do likewise with the SYD-CBR service too if Govt business doesn't increase. The problem is unfortunately one of status and prestige. Exec Govt business fliers do not like ""small"" turboprop aircraft being bussed to the terminal from the aircraft having to declare to their colleagues in Qantas Club that they are flying Rex etc. etc. They like to be waited on hand and foot and have Business Class-size seats waiting for them at the end of a sealed corridor. It's a status/prestige thing that's all. If Rex could afford to operate midsize business jets on these premium services they would get more Govt business. Since this is not a viable option for them it must focus on regional services and forget the major trunk routes I fear to remain solvent.",9/28/2004,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Juneja,1,Return flight London-Tashkent. Easy check in and access to Business Lounge at Heathrow good choice of food on board. Cabin Crew very friendly. Both flights on time. Given Fast Track voucher on arrival to LHR which saved me a good hour avoiding the queue. The only complaint - I could not get miles for Star Alliance.,1/18/2013,5,4,5,3,5,10
Anders Pedersen,1,DAR-ADD-NBO. Flights briefly on time. First leg was a Boeing 319. Good food. IFE shared mini-TV ceiling monitors not so interesting. Good care of passengers by FAs. 2 hot food options both were tasty and exotic. Call bells attended to. Second leg the 4th Dreamliner procured by Ethiopian: advanced aircraft free wifi and power outlet. Manual controls of window shading strength (like sunglasses) worked perfectly. Seats were surprisingly cramped and narrow not spacious. Aircraft almost full. Staff did their best to service all passengers. Call-buttons responded to moderately. Food absolutely edible Italian pasta with Ethiopian spiced chicken came out well. Served French land-wines in mini bottles tolerable though no options beyond white and red. Soft drinks plenty and 2 beers offered (Carlsberg and Heineken). IFE worked easy to manoeuvre buttons. IFE kept running until aircraft standstill and pax were permitted to use earphones till the end. Personal screens personal choice of movies etc. Footrests nice. Quiet aircraft: Only wind-noise were heard and easy to talk with other pax. I would give 7 points for 1st trip and 9 points for 2nd hence the total score become 9.,6/2/2013,3,3,4,4,4,9
Alan Krawec,1,LHR-MRU April 13: Tight seats and small IFE screens but overall an adequate level of service. Friendly flight crew. Food unspectacular but okay. MRU-CDG April 21: Same tight seats but bigger screens for IFE. Everything else the same as outbound flight.,5/4/2014,4,3,3,3,4,7
A Pittaway,1,LHR-CAN-MNL and return. I must admit that when I booked with China Southern I was a bit nervous about it as I had read several poor reviews but I needn't have worried as all the flights were fine. We were travelling with a 6 month old baby which proved to be no problem. There was no bassinets available on the LHR-CAN leg (which was fine as my daughter will not sleep in a bassinet at all) so they gave us a row to ourselves so we had plenty of room. They gave us a row to ourselves on all legs thereafter. Flights were on time. Dreamliner was all fresh and new. Food was as good if not better than other airlines I have flown with. All the staff were pleasant and very helpful - especially with the baby. The layover in Guangzhou was overnight on both outward and return and they provided hotels each time. Both hotels were of the highest quality. We managed to miss the bus to the hotel on the outward leg so they upgraded us to the Pullman Hotel at the airport which is only a few mins walk. We will definitely fly with them again.,1/25/2014,3,3,4,5,5,10
Anders Pedersen,1,Domestic Vietnam HAN-SGN-HAN on 10 and 12 October 2014. Airbus 320 both ways. Delays but I was informed early (SMS and email) and eventually in both cases - offered even better departure times as compared to what I was booked for. Staff nicely dressed in fresh youth style with black T-shirts (with discrete logo) and trousers. They were fast alert smiling and very friendly despite the flight was full to the very last seat. This is a LCC without free onboard service - but prices are low e.g. a hot meal (4 options) is 3 dollars inc. soft drink. The gift shop onboard offers e.g. colourful ladybags with airline logos for 4 USD. Jetstar depends on bus transfers in both airports as LCC carriers obviously do not get access the direct boarding/disembarkation gates.,10/22/2014,5,4,5,1,5,7

Alan Layne,0,"Bad service. Paid for seat upgrade but video monitor did not work. Every seat except middle seats behind the wing have an upgrade fee. Beverage service is poor at best and even a Coke costs $3 (""but you get the whole can""). Bag fees are increasing yet again. As a Denver native I am sad to say I will never fly Frontier again and will discourage anybody else from doing so. Like with Spirit Air Indigo Partners ruined another once great airline. But hey they turn the biggest profit in the industry so screw the passengers.",3/28/2015,2,1,1,1,1,NaN
A Plug,1,Perth-Kalgoorlie same-day return. F50 outward F100 return. Quick and efficient check-in. Aircraft ageing but clean and well-kept inside and out. Seats reasonably comfortable for tall people. Ground and cabin staff friendly cheerful helpful and very professional. Was promised breakfast but only a snack provided. Ticket prices quite expensive even considering late booking.,1/25/2013,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,7
A Karjalainen,0,HEL-JFK-HEL. Modern Airbus 330. Excellent service both onboard and in the airport. Food was above average. Entertainment system was working properly lot's of smiles from the flight crew during service making me feel comfortable.,9/24/2011,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
Anders Pedersen,1,NBO-EDL-NBO. Domestic flights all on time. Due to the newly burnt NBO airport boarding was primitive and lengthy and we were 5-10 passengers who lost our flight due to lack of calls for boarding other routes were announced clearly. As there was a mess in the temporarily domestic airport there were no facilities no signboard nor search for passengers. Strangely enough my luggage was unloaded (correctly) but I was furious as I was accused for No Show despite sitting straight in front of the only exit way in the tent where all domestic passengers had to walk through to their flights. However some apology was received and they rebooked me instantly for the following morning but only as a â€œprioritized waitlist passenger. However I got the last seat and was pleased to eventually get it. Otherwise all flights on time pleasant FA-service and good announcements on board. Almost new aircraft's Embraer 175 and 170 respectively. No lounges available despite holding SkyTeam Gold. After request they offered me 1 snack and 1 soft drink in Nairobi. The lounge in EDL not available for non-VIPs.,8/26/2013,3,4,3,0,4,5
Alan Mackenzie,1,CPH-FCO-CPH June 2012. Norwegian is still one of the best low-cost carriers in my experience. Their treatment of passengers is efficient and pleasant. Flights are on schedule and uneventful. One of the positive points I particularly like is the opening of check in at Rome Airport 3 hours before the flight time. The only gripes I have are the lack of control on oversized cabin-baggage and no on-line check in.,6/17/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,10
A Katara,1,BOM-LHR-BOM. Food was too little and tasteless for the most part. Was served a cupcake and 100 ml of Orange juice for a breakfast meal. Only one drink served voluntarily by the crew ask for a second and they will hesitantly oblige. The only good thing about the flights was the seat which is better than BA or AI that fly this route. IFE needs to be updated and maintained only left side headphone worked for both flights.,4/4/2012,3,5,1,3,3,6
Alan Mackenzie,1,CPH-LHR August 2012. Internet check-in 22 hours before flying. SAS has a habit of blocking off a number of seats so the choice can be somewhat limited during internet check-in. I noted a number of unused seats on the plane in rows ahead of us which had not been available. After a 45 minute Bus and Metro journey we arrived at Copenhagen T3. A fairly new terminal used almost exclusively by SAS. We were obliged to register and print out our baggage labels from one of the kiosks before we dropped off our bags in less than two minutes (having noticed that although the L/H side of the terminal had horrendous queues the R/H side had only one or two passengers â€“ SAS really should have staff to direct passengers with bags). Security was reasonably quiet. The A-321 was l full clean and bright and we were offered a free cup of tea or coffee everything else was paid for. Arrived before time at terminal 3 Heathrow border control was fully manned and our luggage came through 5 minutes after. All in all not bad; if you keep your wits about you.,8/23/2012,5,4,2,0,4,8
A Poli,0,"I will never use Spirit again. The little bit and I do mean little bit that I saved was not worth it. My flight to Fort Lauderdale was delayed three hours because another Spirit plane that was broken down was blocking our gate. No updates were given beforehand so I was at the airport for five hours before we left. That is not fun with two small children! You would think that they might offer us a complimentary glass of water for that hassle but they did not. Nothing at all! I was lucky but some other passengers had no rental car when we got to the airport because of our late arrival! The saga continues for my return flight. We were sitting on the plane for a half hour before we took off due to ""high traffic"" in LaGuardia airport. What is that about? Then we arrive in NY and the pilot tells us ""when it rains it pours"" and informs us that there is a gate door malfunction and we must wait for a power source. That and waiting for our bags took another hour. The stress was not worth the tiny savings. With all the extra fees uncomfortable seats and poor service I saved nothing. Do yourself a favor and don't use Spirit.",2/24/2015,1,1,1,1,3,1
A Kearney,1,LH2482 MUC-LHR. First time flying with Lufthansa and very impressed. Flight was on time cabin crew attentive and good inflight service (bar service tea/coffee and tasty sandwiches provided) - significantly better than that offered on most short haul European flights. Would definitely use again.,3/21/2014,5,4,4,0,5,10
Anders Pedersen,1,CPH-WAW-HAN. ATR 170 first leg and Boeing 767-300 on second. Tickets at very reasonable price. Fastest connection CPH-HAN. Precise arrivals and departures. Airline not up to 4 star but provides good value for the money. Inaugural flight celebrations in airport in Hanoi and onboard for the new route. Customers provided with champagne souveners flowers. Food good though not perfect. Seats not flat no personal TV screen on biz-class. TV sets are portable and must be set up by staff on the serving trays which then become unavailable for other uses eg. meals laptop etc.,11/17/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,6
A Kellett,1,Have flown 4 times to Cluj or Targu Mures from Luton in the last two years. All flights were on time and checking in was fine. The seats are a bit tight I am 5'11 but I have known worse. The cabin staff have always been fine if a little perfunctory. On all our flights the service was basic but reasonably efficient and cheap. Would definitely use again.,7/30/2013,5,3,3,0,4,8
Anders Pedersen,1,Flew HAN-BKK-DOH-DWC (Dubai â€œWorld) and return to Hanoi in March 2015 in economy (HAN-BKK-HAN on B777-3) business (BKK-DOH on A380 and DOH-BKK on B777) and first (DOH-DWC-DOH on A320) respectively. Fantastic airline in all classes. Except for â€œFirstâ€ within middle East which is not â€œrealâ€ First on a A320 as the seats are only typical old style bz/class seats. But as for the A380 the bz class gives a sublime experience almost to perfection. The bar onboard offers intelligently other brands of drinks as those on the menu card served while seated. I like the herring bone seat layout and found the trip cozy and staff caring. Ate at demand. Sophisticated drink lists with many expensive items offered like several wines one normally does not access easily. As usual poor on beer options. Only small portions of food offered as compared to earlier business class experiences with QR. Staff alert and professional and truly caring. A great experience. All flights on time except one which caused a missing connection however QR instantly rebooked to my satisfaction and eventually I arrived on time to final destinations. They have a tendency to close servicing passengers on board far too early before landing (approx. 40 minutes) which is disappointing and unnecessary annoying.,3/30/2015,5,5,4,4,5,9
A Poole,1,LHR-FCO-CTA return in June. Overall it was a good experience but in the months between buying the tickets and the actual flights they changed our itinerary 3 times. This was due to departure time changes and eventually cancellation of the domestic leg. These changes were communicated to us in email and in Italian language without offering alternatives refund or assistance. Bag drop at LHR a bit chaotic as Alitalia operates several flights in the morning and it seemed not enough desks were open. We ended up waiting 40 minutes in the queue before getting fast tracked along with other passengers on the FCO flight. At FCO they seem to operate a coach service for every single flight. One flight out of 4 was significantly delayed (FCO to LHR). I liked the generous legroom on board. No sandwiches given out like BA does on European flights only a small pack of crisps and a drink. Flight attendants were professional and helpful. Despite the above issues I would fly with Alitalia again as they were helpful and professional when needed.,7/9/2013,3,3,2,2,4,7
Alan McClure,1,Flew Birmingham to Sal in early March. Standard seats on the 757 are pretty brutal especially on a longer sector the seat pitch is just too tight to get comfortable. Food provided in the fare was a bonus and acceptable.,3/22/2014,4,2,3,1,4,4
A Kemper,1,YYZ-WRW-PRA return last week. We flew to Warsaw on Air Italy chartered by LOT. Check in took 90 minutes. Hideous food inedible. No special meal provision for low sodium though reserved. Warm drinks served twice and never replenished though on their website LOT recommends one glass of water per hour. A few insolent and unhelpful staff. Not enough washrooms. The flight to Prague was on time well staffed clean. We arrived at Prague Airport on May 8 at 1200 for a 1430 flight to Warsaw and a connection to Toronto. The flight to Warsaw was delayed 40 minutes and we were worried that we would miss our connection. The gate crew at Prague arranged for a wheelchair for my partner who was unable to run through Warsaw airport. The flight attendant made certain we would be met at the gate and brought directly to the Toronto flight and flight was held for our arrival. We appreciated this service. The flight Warsaw to Toronto on LOT equipment was comfortable enough bathrooms and drinks. The marvellous measure of their service was that our luggage made it too!,5/9/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,7
Alan McGaughey,1,Flew recently Dublin to Birmingham return for Â£20 return - unbelievable fare. Flights were very busy. There was the traditional queue for a Ryanair flight even though you have an assigned seat. I prefer to wait until the queue is actually moving and join the queue then instead of standing for no reason. No complaints about the flight - I think some of the food/drinks are overpriced but in general there is a good selection. I have noticed on recent Ryanair flights that the level of customer service have improved. There seems to be more Irish and British crew on the Irish and British flights too. I noticed the crew were especially friendly with the children on board with 2 young kids being shown into the cockpit as they saw the pilot on exiting the plane and the male cabin crew member on the tramac waving at other children as they came down the aircraft steps. Flight was good going back as well arriving in Dublin area. Great service for just Â£20 return.,5/13/2015,5,4,3,NaN,4,8
Anders Pedersen,1,SGN-DOH-NBO on 14 June 2014. Metal was A330-200 and A320 respectively. Both flights on time. Lounge access granted in SGN and DOH due to my status card to the airline. Got the seat I wanted and when on board I got assistance by FA to remove intruders encroaching my row. Opportunity to flat out on both sectors. A dinner served after midnight was of poor quality (warm snack) but edible. Champagne offered in economy class upon request. Staff alert and welcoming. New airport in Hamad Doha is still a mess too many staff that don't know how to help lots of bottlenecks too few toilets too few lounges (many pax denied access due to fully crowded lounges). Those denied were given â€œgift-vouchersâ€ which force them to queue up for long time to actually get them. Many regional flights and â€œsmall destinations like NBO are still not accessed directly by gates but require the usual awful humiliating imprisoning bus-rides. QR are still delivering FA and ground staff are world class. However the food quality is sliding a bit and the concept on board could need some refreshing. No choice on beers. Wines are acceptable and provide 4 choices plus champagne on some sectors.,6/16/2014,5,4,3,4,5,8
A Powers,0,We travelled Madrid-Barcelona at the beginning of March. Due to computer inability to check-in on-line (it seems I may not have been able to anyway as I am not an EU citizen) and some transportation issues we arrived 2 minutes after 'check-in' time. We did not have luggage to check-in. We were treated rather rudely. We were refused check-in. When I tried to re-book we were informed that we had to pay for another flight (at a significantly higher price). I may have mis-understood the airline info (but there is so much of it) and had understood that if we missed our flight we could re-book with a penalty fee. Apparently this only works if you check in. Well if one misses their flight they likely haven't had a chance to check-in. What is the point of all this check-in etc on domestic flights. I bought a ticket of course I want to use it. This isn't a cheap or efficient airline. My recommendation take the train!,3/19/2014,1,3,0,0,1,NaN
A Khan,1,AMM-CAI-LUX LUX-CAI-ATH. We chose Egyptair for relatively cheap fares and convenience around Egypt and the middle east. First flight ordinary cabin crew was a little incompetent and seemed a bit young. Flights to and from Luxor were alright nothing bad but nothing too good either. Flight to Athens was quite pleasant nice and friendly staff food edible for once.,11/22/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,5
Alan McQuillan,1,LHR-BHD. Had flown to London Premium Economy and Economy on the return with a seat at the back of a very full plane. At the bag drop there was almost no queue - the check-in lady seemed to be Spanish with limited English. BMI staff in the air are brilliant. At Belfast and other airports except Heathrow they are great. At Heathrow the ground staff seem to have been recruited from the Ryanair Charm School.,2/8/2012,4,3,3,0,5,7
A Khasawneh,0,IST-LHR the so called business class is a joke and is virtually indistinguishable from economy on any decent airline seats are crammed together and do not recline properly there is no sort of entertainment whatsoever on a four hour flight. Having flown on Turkish Royal Jordanian Emirates and Cathay Pacific in the past couple of months only made the contrast more striking. Never again!,5/8/2015,2,1,2,1,1,2
Anders Pedersen,1,NBO-DOH-SGN on 29 March. Airbus 320 (3x3 seat configuration) and 330 (2x4x2 seat configuration) respectively. Aircraft's neat and in good condition. Flights on time. Announcements were good. Staff attending and try their best though rarely suggest outside the box. Priority members highly respected recognized and acknowledged. FAs hardworking and attentive call buttons answered quickly. IFE good but not of my priority. Night-flights after midnight serve no dinner in economy very annoying for me. No beer options only a trivial Heineken is offered. What a pity as the world have so much better options to offer. Doha airport still a nightmare packed and imprisoned in busses without information or reasoning. A 2-days delayed bag from my previous trip was not compensated.,3/30/2014,4,4,3,4,4,7
A Kidd,0,Travelled on CX100 to Paris on 16 April 2015 and returned CX111 14th May economy class. Both flights were full except for a couple of seats. Overall my trip was average. Limited number of toilets for that many people. Food was minimal and bland compared to other airlines. On my first leg of the trip the sound was not working and the only choice I had was to move to the very back of the plane. It totally spoilt my trip. There was no foot peddle to rest your feet on so the pressure is reduced to the back of the legs. This is very important for 'short people' to reduce the risk of DVT. All other airlines flying the long leg have them. The water given to passengers was very metallic in taste and not drinkable. When we flew out of Hong Kong the security staff suddenly set up a barrier just before entering the plane and confiscated all the passengers water bottles and duty free bottles. How is this acceptable when the duty free stores sell you alcohol only to have this confiscated before boarding. They said this was an Australian ruling. A number of people requested bottles of water when entering the cabin but were refused. Why wasn't there an announcement before entering the aircraft that bottled water was not allowed. I would not have bought my new bottle and OJ prior to boarding. We could only get the 'metal tasting water'. The crew were accommodating but that's all. The seat in front of me did not stay completely upright. The man sitting in it was large but I felt that he would collapse in my lap any moment. The maintenance for the aircraft could have been better.,5/31/2015,2,2,2,1,4,2
Alan O'Connor,1,DUB-LIN and VRN-DUB - The usual Aer Lingus service. On time clean planes friendly FA's. Quite happy that they are enforcing the carry on luggage rule as planes now get off on time. I don't know why people are complaining about having to pay for food. Most EI flights are 2.5 hours or less. Eat before you leave or else bring your own food and stop complaining. I'm very happy with them and will continue to use them. For the fare you pay (if you book well in advance) I have few complaints about the service.,11/5/2012,5,5,3,3,5,10
A Praszek,0,Recently flew LHR-AUH-LHR with a stopover in Doha. It wasn't my first time that I used QA but I sincerely hoped that their service will improve. I was wrong! Ground staff during the check-in at LHR was not nice. People you need to start smiling! Airbus A340 was spacious so there were no problems with a legroom. Inflight entertainment was ok. Cabin crew was inattentive sometimes not polite. I have asked for a glass of water before they started serving the meal but didn't get any Crew member looked unsatisfied when I interrupted her with a glass of water request. I also had to remind them about the bland meal that I've pre-ordered. Return flight from Abu Dhabi to Doha had 1 hour delay. It was a miracle that I've managed to catch a LHR flight which also arrived in London with a 20-minute delay. Despite their cheap fares I'm not going to fly with Qatar Airways anymore. I'll better pay more for a flight with a competitor airline.,5/11/2015,3,3,2,1,1,4
Anders Pedersen,1,CPH-AMS-CPH in Go class with A320 on 18 and 22 December 2014. 1st trip on time 2nd delayed 90 Minutes due to severe winds in AMS which affected all flights negatively. SK handled it well and fuelled the plane extra in AMS to speed up pace and caught 25 Minutes back on the delay when arriving CPH. Service is prompt but very modest GO is a â€œno-GOâ€. Aircraft's were clean FAâ€™s were smiling professional. Announcements were very good and informative (no crap). Extremely cheap ticket return bought long time in advance for 150 USD. Other options for travelling return on this route were at least double the price of SAS. 2 pieces of luggage and lounge access fully granted (I have a gold card in other Star Alliance partner).,12/31/2014,5,4,2,1,5,8
Alan Petten,1,YUL-FRA April 2015. A330 was in good shape. I like the arrangement of Air Canada's business class I am tall and find their lay-flat bed system to have plenty of room unlike some airlines. Staff were friendly and attentive. Food service was good.,4/27/2015,4,5,5,5,5,10
A Proctor,1,First time flier with Easyjet Manchester to Paphos return in April 2014. I had not considered Easyjet previously due to poor impression generated by TV documentary. However our expectations were exceeded on both flights. Rapid check in using speedy boarding; friendly efficient staff; very modern clean plane; the extra leg room seats were spacious and firm yet comfortable. Prices competitive. Did not have a meal but refreshments were fine. Flights were on time for both outward and inbound. Highly recommended.,5/18/2014,4,4,0,NaN,5,9
A King,0,Flew Heathrow to Melbourne. It was a pretty terrible experience all round. First flight to HKG was a 747-400. The seats were bizarre they did not recline but the seat slid forward a little bit and the support for the bottom of your back is rock hard. Terrible pockets on the seat in front mean if you put anything more than a newspaper in there the seat pocket is touching your knees. Also as with all Cathay flights I've been on there was no personal air conditioning control. Food as always was terrible - 2 meals on a 12 hour flight both of which were not nice at all. Breakfast choice always seems to be an egg based dish or seafood congee. I'd rather just have cereal next time. The dinner is always a choice of an oversalted Asian dish a vegetarian pasta dish or something else unappetising. Having already flown the opposite route we luckily knew to take snacks on board so we didn't starve. With Qantas / Emirates I usually end up feeling almost overfed not with Cathay though where you feel like you're in prison. With 2 or 3 hours before landing when breakfast was about to be served my girlfriend noticed that a child on the seat in front had been sick which had trickled between the seats and gone all over her tracksuit pants which were on the floor in front. We tried to get the cabin crews assistance but they continually ignored us. We ended up just putting them in a bag and then throwing them away. Never again! I'd rather pay an extra $300 to fly Qantas / Emirates than fly with Cathay again.,10/1/2013,3,3,2,3,3,4
Anders Pedersen,1,"BUD-IST-YYZ-IST-BUD. BUD Ground services are horrible confusing and mean spirited towards the passenger. The inflight hard- ware experience is very good (seat toilets aircraft IFE etc.) but the human resources are like a lottery of low probabilities of meeting a winner or just someone to recall after a weekâ€¦BUD-IST-BUD sectors on A319 and B737 respectively. Only 2 rows assigned for business class and the seats were economy seats. However with only two passengers for the 12 seats available space was more than enough and one could lay down stretched out by lifting armrests. As for B737 there were old but true business class seats in a 2x2 configurations in 3 rows). Flights on time. Excellent service on board. Champagne at take-off. Special meal ordered almost a year in advance was given. Three more hot meals were presented and given by FA who were proud of their many options. Thus I had cold seafood platter as starter hot salmon as 1st maincourse and as 2nd main course: kofta 3rd main course: pasta and 4th rice with giant prawns. Cheese platter of high quality. Good advice on wines. IST-YYZ-IST on Boeing 777-300. Perfect hardware (inclusive WiFi) and excellent food. However the staff (FAs) has a lot to improve on - Language Socializing Read and understand passengers minds and needs. They need to avoid speaking Turkish to ""all"" passengers and could recruit a bulk of international staff to beef up Spanish Chinese Vietnamese Thai French Arab and â€¦English. The timing of service inputs need improvement. Sense of FA-humour is nil FA's avoidance of passengers is felt -â€“ one could sit on the entire flight without being offered more than 10% of what are available.",5/24/2014,5,5,4,4,2,7
A Pruba,0,Melbourne (Tulla) to Gold Coast - flight delayed more than an hour with no explanation. Finally boarded at 6.55 (flight was scheduled to leave at 5.40) where the pilot briefed us that there was an issue with a passenger onboard the previous flight hence the delay. The flight crew then conducted their safety spiel as well as cross checking. We then sat on the tarmac a further 50 minutes! I've flown with Tiger once before this trip and found the staff rude and unhelpful. I thought I'd luck out this time but it was by far the worst air trip of my life. Unfortunately need to return to Melbourne with them but never again after that. You get what you pay for.,4/25/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A King,0,Just yesterday I had the worst experience I've ever had with any airline We were booked to fly out of Cancun directly to Dallas with Spirit Airlines. They had overbooked the flight by about 7 people and everyone showed up some people volunteered to give up their seats for the usual compensation package. My partner and I checked in online in the morning prior to the flight. We arrived to the airport and waited at the check in counter as they were getting another couple checked in printed boarding passes checked luggage and sent those passengers on their way to the gate. They however denied us help denied offering any customer service or compensation because they said we had arrived too late to print off boarding passes but they did admit to use that they had knowledge of our online check in. Then while we were standing at the counter with 4 other passengers Spirit Airlines proceeded to book flights and offer hotel and ticket compensation to the other passengers. I will never fly Spirit Airlines again.,9/6/2014,1,1,1,1,1,1
A Purr,1,I was a little concerned about flying with Air Canada after reading some of the negative reviews on here but I should never have been. I flew on flight AC851 on the 18 May 2014 and I have to say the cabin crew on this flight were absolutely great they were helpful friendly and cheerful in their work and nothing was too much trouble. They made our flight enjoyable! Food was good for an airline seat comfort was good and although there were some delays before take off this was due to Heathrow ground staff and no fault of Air Canada.,6/5/2014,5,5,5,5,5,10
Anders Pedersen,1,HAN-DAD on an Airbus 320-200. New LCC-carrier in Indochina. Very busy afternoon got the last seat with very short notice. Service and interior colorful young talkative FAs. Check-in smooth and at a good visible location. Flight delayed 30 Minutes. There are many food and drink items and the prices are in general very reasonable â€“ even compared to Vietnamese prices. Due to crowded airport and due to low priority to LCCs by the airport the busdrive to the aircraft became cumbersome and tedious. The carrier resembles AirAsia though slightly less professional.,7/21/2013,3,4,3,0,4,6
A Kleissner,1,We flew from Gatwick to Istanbul (return) and Istanbul - Izmir (return). Planes varied - the least good was a workaday Airbus between Istanbul and Izmir (nothing wrong with it though) the best a brand new B737-800 to Gatwick. We flew economy but noted that business class on the latter had excellent seats. All flights flew to time. Food was very good (complete with metal cutlery). Even between Istanbul and Izmir we got an hors d'oeuvre plus a good sandwich and some cake - the crew hardly had time to serve it. All staff polite and helpful. At Izmir we had checked-in online and were shown to a dedicated counter: there is no Bag Drop facility. All in all one of our best airline experiences.,7/6/2014,5,4,4,4,5,9
A R Hakim,0,Luton to Nice. We were ready to board agent came into waiting area looking for 20 bags to go into hold. As there were no volunteers she came into waiting room and I can only say she very aggressively was looking to force the issue with a number of unfortunate passengers. She picked on my wife and insisted luggage to go into hold and she then decided to take my bag as well. We protested and she threatened to ban us from boarding. When we boarded I found at least 7 similar or larger bags had been allowed on. We had no such problems on return flight where French Staff were helpful and polite - complete opposite to Luton Staff.,6/23/2013,0,3,4,NaN,1,NaN
Anders Pedersen,1,Domestic Hanoi-Dalat-Hanoi 22-25 November 14. Good hardware (all flights Airbus 321) lounges well equipped with soft drinks and beers. Other alcoholic drinks available but completely substandard. Food mediocre but options prevailed. Check in smooth efficient and call buttons on board answered within 4-8 seconds. Food onboard unbearable forget these ugly Western cold snacks. No hot dishes and no options but one useless plate of white bread sandwich which has no market neither within nor outside Vietnam - a scandal for the country. Staff alert polite limited English. IFE working but no handset speakers given. Only one terrible US entertainment movie shown. Priority embarking and disembarking - a lot of courtesy from FAs but all in all very conservative quiet experience.,12/1/2014,4,5,2,1,5,7
A Kola,0,TCX816 29/1/14 TCX854 9/2/14. MAN - Barbados - MAN. Outbound asked 4 times for a blanket only when the duty free trolley came round was I able to get one as I refused to buy anything until I got a blanket. Return trip had no blankets or pillows and the worst vegetarian meal I have tasted. A joke for long haul and the price we have to pay and no alternative other than expensive snacks.,2/18/2014,2,2,2,0,2,3
A Kowald,1,BNE-TSV in A320 September 2013. Flight up on JQ906 was good - delay caused by passengers made up in air service efficient seat pitch and width adequate for a quick flight. 5 hours before departure we received a text message and email informing that the return flight had been cancelled - called Jetstar customer service and were put on to a slightly later QF and were given a $200 voucher for future Jetstar travel. Very happy with Jetstar customer service - particularly as the tickets were super cheap sale fares on a low cost carrier.,9/9/2013,5,4,0,0,4,10
A Raimantera,0,I rebooked my flight because of family bereavement. My original booking was upgraded to business class from yellow coloured seat I booked earlier. I paid the penalty for my flight Gold Coast to Singapore. Less than 12 hours before my flight I realized that my seat allocation had gone. Not only the business class upgrade but also the yellow coloured seat. If I want to return to my original seat I have to pay again 14 Singapore dollars which I am not happy to do but no choice. What surprises me is that Scoot can give yellow coloured seat number 52 for free but not my original seat number 23. It just does not make sense to me. First I lost my seat allocation and upgrade to business class now Scoot asked me for SGD 14 at the last minute. I won't be flying Scoot again. It is useless to be a loyal Scoot flyer.,9/19/2013,3,2,2,1,1,2
A Kruger,1,Quito to Medellin Business Class A320. We were travelling on an Avianca/Taca ticket but the flight was operated by Aerogal. Check-in was efficient although in Quito only opens 2 hours before the flight. We used the VIP lounge in UIO basic selection of snacks and drinks but comfortable seats. Flight was 15 mins late boarding. Business Class seats are large recliners with leg supports and very good IFE offering for short haul. A hot meal was served with a large bar selection. The only disappointment was the attitude and service onboard. Everything was a hassle for FA's. Landed on time and a fairly simple connection process to the domestic Avianca flight.,1/10/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,6
Anders Pedersen,1,Domestic travels SGN-HUI-SGN-BMV-SGN-HUI-SGN. The airline is falling behind and no innovations for ages. A good amount of FA's have absolutely nothing to do apart from dishing out a bottle of water. Check-in from provinces only possible at the earliest 2 hours before travel (at times very limiting of flexibility). Transfers not possible with onward connections: one is dropped out to collect luggage queue up for check in and security for ages (in Saigon 1-2 hours typically). What an unnecessary hassle and waste of time instead of allowing domestic transits. Tickets purchased in airports are not properly invoiced just typewrittenâ€ and very basic. No entertainment of FA interaction on board but only a roaring silence during flights. Other airlines now take advantage of this ailing boring conservative airline (Jetstar Vietjetair Mekong etc.) and have a fresh appeal. On the positive site: Delays are relatively rare. Luggage allowance are de facto generous. They have plenty town offices which provide direct services.,12/25/2013,3,4,1,1,3,4
A Randolph,0,Washington DC to Paris (with layovers in Iceland) and then returned from London to DC through Canada. It was the worst flying experience I've had. The airport is small with only 2 toilets per sex and only one sink. On top of that they had 3 major flights departing at the same time leading to long lines of people waiting to use the restroom. They also had very few chairs in the waiting area so most people were standing or waiting on the ground. No free food on the flight - not even pretzels. They do not turn on the air- conditioning while boarding the plane so it's incredibly hot and uncomfortable. On top of all this they gave us no notice that we would have to go through customs upon landing in Canada and then go check back in to another airline. Our tickets did not mention this at all. They only gave us a 2 hour layover to complete all these tasks. We almost missed our flight and we were so rushed our luggage did not make the flight. It was an absolutely awful experience. It is not worth the cost savings.,8/31/2012,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,2
A Krummacher,1,BKK-PNH-BKK. Outbound 04/06/2013 on PG 931 on a relatively newish A319. Flight took off with a 30 minutes delay no explanation no apology given. Cheerful and friendly crew. Very tasty breakfast. Uneventful flight landed after 50 mins. Return 06/06/2013 on PG 934 on an old A320. On-time departure. Nice crew responding quickly to any type of requests. Fish served for lunch. Landed on schedule.,6/6/2013,3,3,4,2,4,8
Anderson Feng,1,Booked over a month in advance for my wife and I. Then try to check in online the night before and they have us in different rows both flights. When I called the agent said maybe because we have different names. Really? So even if you book at the same time they assume you are not together? First flight we were able to get seats together arranged by agent at front desk but connecting flight the flight crew told us to ask people in the seats if they would switch with us. Thankfully a passenger was more accommodating than the airline staff.,8/18/2014,4,4,3,2,3,7
Alan Petten,1,MUC-BKK April 2014 - Older 747-400 was tired. Unfortunately the business class is 2-2 which means window passenger has to climb over the aisle passenger to get out which isn't easy when bed extended. Seat wasn't as comfortable as I expected would have been nice if they were true lie-flat. Service and food were good boarding process for Thai seems very chaotic they could be more organized with that.,4/27/2015,4,2,4,3,4,7
A Kucera,1,BRU-PRG-BRU. Altogether very satisfied one flight with older 737 the other with new A319. Check in procedure was smooth and uncomplicated in both cases. The flight with A319 was very nice with inflight screens with maps. The flight with 737 was bit worse as it was an older plane. The food and drinks on both flights were quite well for nowadays standards on European flights. The crew both in plane and on ground very nice and helpful.,9/12/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
Andersson Anders,1,I travelled from Vienna to Copenhagen on December 3 Business Class seat 3F. This afternoon service was operated by a Fokker 100. Although this specific aircraft type has been in service for quite some years it had a totally new interior. The interior looked smart and attractive and the seat was very comfortable. I would say the best seat I have ever experienced on an Intra-European flight. The service was excellent and so was the food and drinks served. In total a very pleasant experience. I would highly recommend travelling with Austrian Airlines on Intra- European flights in Business Class.,12/4/2013,5,5,5,3,5,10
A Ray,0,"I might have been in economy for service, food and seating, 8 abreast. No room to move. If you are over 80kg or 6', you're squashed completely. WC clean with paper towels. Adequate IFE. The difference between older crew on prior sectors and young cabin crew on this flight was stark. They were polite and totally wooden. On past sectors the older crew took the time to know you and, as a frequent flyer, even say thanks for choosing BA. Hung clothes returned crushed. The dinner was the same as Jet Airways domestic economy. Breakfast at 03.30 a bit of fruit, tepid tea, pastry and egg roll served out of alfoil. Club World is like a stretched Economy with a Business Class fare.",7/20/2015,2,2,1,2,1,3
Alan Pratt,1,Two good flights to and from IAD. Airbus330-300 generally comfortable except seats become hard further into the flight. FAs good on both flights plenty of runs through the cabin with water or juice. Both flights departed on time. Arrived in IAD late due to weather conditions.,11/3/2014,4,3,3,4,5,8
A Kumar,0,HNL-SFO. Self-service check-in quick although not enough personnel to help through the relatively complex system. Bags are weighed and you even self-tag the bags before dropping it off. Potentially efficient but the communication needs to be better. However the extra charges are ridiculous on Hawaiian. Check in per bag at $70 movies at $12 extra legroom seats at $70 again. I know American carriers practice ala carte pricing but Hawaiian's charges are more then other carriers. The so-called trumpeted meal service was a few bland pieces of chicken with rice an aged salad and a piece of chocolate. The final straw however was the crew. While sitting on a bulkhead seat after paying the ridiculous charges passengers were trampling on my feet to get to the other aisle. When I advised the crew they said its not their problem. Bags in SFO took ages mitigating an on-time arrival. Sorry Hawaiian but serving sub-standard complimentary food does not allow you to rip off passengers with extra charges and poor service. Next time I am bringing my own food on-board and flying Delta!,7/30/2013,1,3,2,2,2,3
Andjani Rasya,1,Flew CGK-KUL vv. Quite disappointed with MH meals nowadays. In CGK-KUL crew offered fish or chicken and I chose fish which taste so-so and it came with mori biscuit. No chocolate or a cup of water like they used to give. In KUL-CGK it was even worse only a cold tuna sandwich which tasted horrible and orange pudding. But IFE was good crew were attentive and cheerful and got sky interior on both sectors but I expected more for the meal.,7/17/2014,2,4,1,4,4,6

If somebody had explained that the plane was being diverted to Cork and we were then being bussed back to Waterford we would have made alternative arrangements. When we were given our Â£3 lunch voucher we were told that our flight was in Cork. No mention that our flight was being diverted to Cork as well. When we arrived at Cork there was nobody to guide us to the baggage it was not labelled we eventually found the bus! At no time were we told what was happening total lack of communication.,7/31/2012,1,1,1,0,1,1
A Kumar,1,XL Airways France is a charter airline that has recently entered the US market. I flew SFO to CDG non-stop and paid $500 less per person than I would have on Air France. That's considerable savings! I read you get what you pay for - well I happen to have flown Air France also and they are no different than XL Airways France. The economy in XLF is very similar to Air France with the exception of IFE/ individual screens. You get two meals on a 10 hour flight - a warm meal after take off and a cold meal before landing. One my first leg I upgraded to Premium Economy for a measly $39. The only difference is a few extra inches of leg room (barely noticeable) and leather seats. You still don't get individual screens (only in Galaxie Class or First Class). Crew is extremely friendly and bilingual.,8/9/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
Andrade Sunita,0,My family of 4 2 adults and 2 children traveled Dubai-Goa-Dubai on 20th Feb to 8 March on Air India direct. On 20th Feb Dubai-Goa the flight was scheduled at 11pm but took off at 12.20am. The delay announcement was very brief and no one was available at the gate for comments. If passengers were told even at 7-8pm in the evening it would have avoided rushing to the airport. Food specially for children could be managed by us etc. We were left standing as there was nowhere available to sit. No entertainment onboard the seat in the front had a torn pocket which had a wire coming out which could be very dangerous for my child. I had ordered a children's meal however on the flight back on 8th March none was given. When we pay a similar fare compared to other flights why can we not get the same services?,3/12/2014,3,1,1,1,3,2
Alan Sargeant,1,Bangkok - Moscow - Simferopol. Flights departed and arrived on time. The crew was professional and reasonable friendly. The level of English was more than adequate. The hand held entertainment systems between Bangkok and Moscow were rather dated and substandard for a business class cabin. There was no entertainment on the shorter Moscow - Simferopol sector. From Bangkok to Moscow the cabin was almost full but service standards were maintained. Food was good. From Moscow to Simferopol the cabin the crew served a good meal on the short flight.,8/29/2012,4,4,4,3,4,8
A Kupferman,0,Flying from Bangkok to Delhi Jet Airways offers a business class on their B737 which could not even be compared to an Economy Deluxe Class in other airlines: old seats with reduced pitch lousy entertainment system (tiny overhead screens image so dark it cannot be seen) no toiletries food very average crew indifferent disappears after serving breakfast does not come back if more coffee is needed water is not offered during flight a miserable experience all in all but you can learn from experiences and so I will never fly Jet Airways again. If this is India's best airline I cannot imagine how other airlines fare.,11/25/2013,2,2,3,1,2,2

A Razak,0,BA12 15th August 2014. In my mind that when I bought the BA tickets it would be a great flight experience based on their reputation as a 4 star airline. It turned out to be totally wrong. I used to travel with other airlines it seems that my flight experience with BA from Changi Airport to Heathrow was the worst in so many ways. Not worth money spent at all! Firstly the seat space was really small (I cant imagine those who are bigger than I am because I am a medium size person). Secondly the proportion of food served was not generous in comparison to other airlines. They only served food twice for that 12 hour long haul journey. Thirdly the service was considered moderate and it seemed like no one cared about the toilets in economy class (no one bothered to top up the toilet rolls). Lastly the inflight entertainment was so back dated. The movies selection must have been 2 years old. Flimsy earphones and outdated screens. All in all an unhappy customer.,8/28/2014,1,1,1,2,2,4
Alan Sargeant,1,Bangkok-Almaty (Business) Almaty-Astana-Novosibirsk. The Business Class was very good and liked the beds. There was plenty of space but would prefer truly flat beds. Friendly check-in in Bangkok and food was better than expected. Allowed to stay in the Business lounge while I waited for the connecting flight to Astana. Business lounge in Bangkok was very ordinary and toilets were in a different area. Almaty-Astana-Novosibirsk. Everything was adequate and better food than I expected.

The onboard service is now almost non-existent even on long flights you will get at most a tiny cold snack with a glass of beverage!

Alan Sargeant,1,Warsaw-Helsinki-Bangkok. Flights on time good connection in Helsinki. Warsaw to Helsinki was an Embraer 190 and Business Class is a bit cramped and has only standard seats without additional leg room. Good friendly service from cabin staff. Enjoyable food and wine. Helsinki to Bangkok I liked the flat bed which made a good sleep possible. Dinner served quickly and efficiently after take off making it possible to get a good sleep. Collecting baggage in Bangkok a problem as my bags were some of the last off the plane and I had to wait 20 minutes for them to come.,10/7/2012,4,5,4,4,5,9

However in September they decided to stop in Johannesburg instead and booked us a transfer from Johannesburg to Capetown. Alas on our way out after an unscheduled stop in Paris to pick up ""a few passengers"" and a 4-5 hour unexplained delay in Tripoli we missed the connecting flight and had to pay Â£200 each for new tickets - despite reassurances from Afriqiyah Airways in Tripoli that they had transferred us onto later flights. In the end we were travelling for over 24 hours. On the way back the travel documents we used to travel out were not accepted in Johannesburg airport and we had to call the UK from a mobile to get further details. Once again we got stuck in Tripoli airport for over ten hours due to snow at Gatwick. Tripoli airport is awful - it is one giant ashtray with disgusting toilets.

Alan Sargeant,1,Bangkok-Melbourne. Quick and efficient check in at Bangkok. Flight left on time for Brunei. Choice of breakfast served early in flight. IFE a bit limited but not a problem on the short sector. Flight from Brunei to Melbourne was about 40 minutes late because of technical problems. Sat on the tarmac for a while and then good flight to Melbourne. Lunch was served at a very leisurely pace and was good food on good china and cutlery. IFE quite good and seats were very comfortable. They made up most of the lost time en route. Service friendly and addressed by name. Changed seats before flight took off and no problems with staff. Business class almost full but service remained good and friendly for the whole flight. They are a three star airline but give excellent value for money and while this remains I will happily fly with them. Baggage did not priority treatment during the unloading phase at Melbourne airport. ( I am not sure if this is an airline or a ground handling problem as it has also occurred on other airlines where baggage is checked in and has to be transferred to a second or third flight).,10/7/2012,5,4,4,4,4,9

The seat was a single window seat 9K - in seating position it was ok but in bed position your legs above knees are to be placed to ""tunnel"" between seats in front of you. Tunnel is so narrow you can't move inside it. Meal service was very slow: my friend in economy finished it and was sleeping when C-class was getting their entrees. It took them more than 3 hours (almost half the flight) to feed us. Then they gave us 1.5 break and woke us up for breakfast - it was a disaster. I had a group of 3 drunk adults seated next to me who were drinking schnapps all flight long laughing and chatting to each other in a loud voice not letting any other in the cabin to sleep.

After staff took my Brazilian passport she started to talk to me very slowly after telling her I spoke fluent Spanish she made odd comments as how she was surprised to see a Brazilian speaking other language than Portuguese. When I asked for a plastic bag to protect my bag which was no problem in San Salvador the same lady said she had run out I asked her colleague who told me she was not going to do it herself so I had to jump over the scales and put the plastic bag on my luggage myself. On board the service was once again good happy and polite staff had a chicken salad with beverages short flight though I can not blame the whole airline for one or two staff members attitude but will think twice when booking a flight in Central America.,1/29/2013,3,4,4,3,2,5

Slightly late departure from London and I found the 777-300ER cabin layout cramped in 3-4-3 configuration the actual seat was reasonably comfortable. Entertainment selection was good with responsive touch screen system and good headphones. The biggest let down for me was the cabin crew they did not really provide any ""good"" service or smiles the male crew in particular I found quite arrogant and more concerned about how they looked. No water runs offered by the crew throughout the flight you had to go to the galley. Return flight to London over an hour late departing and once again I found the crew lacking completely no tea or coffee was offered to me with the breakfast and when I asked the attendant for one he looked at me like I was being a complete pain.

During the 5 hours onboard we were not served food even after asking for at least a sandwich. We were not allowed any hot drinks in case we were going to suddenly take off - which was very unlikely! We were asked to keep our seats upright also in case we were going to suddenly take off! We were then left with no information regarding our next flight details. After managing (with great effort and with absolutely no assistance from Qantas staff) to transfer onto Emirates 18 hours later than initially scheduled to depart. Arrived in DXB without baggage!

The TCL-MNL flight in December and April was delayed by 3 hours I was lucky to made the BKK connection (rushed in minibus over the tarmac from T3 to T2). On all three trips the MNL-TCL flights were delayed by 1 hour. The excuse is always ""late arrival of aircraft"" which they claim is beyond their control! Food on the international flights is inedible I rate it the worst airline food I have come across. On my last MNL-BKK flight it was freezing cold - passengers complaining.

This adds 2 to 3 extra hours to a flight a panic transfer at Hong Kong to Australia. The apologies are insincere and automated. The crew are always too busy accommodating infants and business class to respond to requests. Seats have become less comfortable head sets are cheap and ill fitting flights full and cramped drink selection more restricted. This might make the airline meet its budget but the overall experience for travellers is very taxing. I will search for alternatives.,12/2/2013,3,1,2,2,2,3
Alan Sheldon,1,Flew Gatwick to Palma on 11th November in one of their latest Boeing 737-800. Great flight no complaints. The only thing I would like to know is when Thomson hand luggage allowance will increase from a paltry 5kg to 10kg as other budget lines?,10/28/2014,4,4,0,0,4,8
A Lambert,0,Flew Shanghai - Dubai - Shanghai. I have flown over 120000 miles this year and this was by far the worst experience I have had. All the staff were at least indifferent while some where downright rude there was confusion on one flight where we were given boarding passes for seat numbers that did not exist this happened to other passengers on the same flight. Last part of flight delayed by over 4 hours with no apologies from the flight crew.,12/10/2013,3,3,2,1,1,2
Andre Samouhos,0,Dusseldorf to Vancouver and used Air Berlin because they have a non stop flight. Never have I been on an airline that has such abusive people and a system generated to swindle money out of passengers because of bags. They were rude and knew that when you get to the counter you have no choice but to accept any tactics they use to get money out of you for bags. They will try to charge you 150 Euros for the hand pieces you are carrying which are not overweight and in regulation size. There were at least 15 to 20 passengers who were experiencing the same thing. It was not just one employee who was doing this the passengers realized and were talking about it that employees of AirBerlin had an organized system of telephoning each other to pinpoint passengers that they could charge more from the check in counter to the cashier to the gate check in. Three people on the counter at the gate who were picked out for extra charges for hand pieces were yelling at them for not providing a receipt.,8/7/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
Alan Spencer,0,EWR-GRU-POA roundtrip. Provider was Continental for the 4 legs of the trip. Trip was mostly good. Tam providing the usual problems. For the second time they lost the full ticket configuration and forced me to pay for excess baggage and carry bags in GRU. Amazing that they cannot do such a simple thing like hold on to their records!,4/17/2012,3,2,3,2,3,4
A Lane,1,Now that Flybe is one of Air France's partners we've no choice other than to fly with them to and from MAN and Paris CDG. We have had no problems so far with them on these journeys. We've also used them to fly from Newcastle to Belfast City with no problems. FA's have been professional and friendly. The planes used are not the newest Airbus aircraft but they are comfortable for the short journeys. The legroom is quite good-wish we could have that on our long haul flights. And even nowadays they give complimentary drinks and snacks (e.g. chips biscuits trail mix).,12/12/2012,4,4,4,0,4,8
A Ritzau,1,First Long Haul flight to Dubai from Adelaide EK441 300-777. Found boarding at Adelaide International very professional and easy! Seats were at back of plane. My choice however we picked seats that had immovable solid sides and as I was larger it made it a bit squashed however I was glad of the extra aisle room as the 3 seater areas looked very small and often the passengers seemed to get bumped a lot! Toilets were clean until the end of the trip where they were over used and left messy the food was great. Very tasty and a lot of it. Left feeling full! Cold drinks were warm and hot drinks were cold. Service was great though. Staff seemed very friendly. The comfort bags were good and we used the eye pads and blankets. Ambience of the plane for time zones was good. Entertainment kept me entertained!,10/1/2014,5,3,4,5,4,8
Andrea Barro,0,"Both ground crew and flight attendants lack customer satisfaction skills - treat the customer with indifference. Pre-booked seats outbound and inbound only to find they changed seats both ways without any communication. Plane was old and seats were very uncomfortable. Large TV monitors ran down the middle aisle every 6-7 rows and most didn't work properly. Food was mediocre. Terrible, terrible airline. I would never recommend Alitalia.",7/27/2015,1,1,2,1,1,1
Alan Talbot,0,Singapore to Sydney Nov 2013. Left on time both directions. Got yellow seats for extra space and it was worth it for additional leg room. Service was OK but cool and not very welcoming. Meals which we ordered in advance are poor and don't recommend them other than the Sandwiches and pot noodles which you can buy 'on the go'. The plane was full both ways. The worst experience was the freezing cabin on both flights so much so we became convinced that this was done to 'encourage' us to invest in renting pillows and blankets. I would look for an alternative service for future flights.,12/21/2013,3,3,2,1,3,4
A Roberts,0,When and if Southwest changes its seating policy I will consider flying it again. Unfortunately is pretty much the only airline that flies to ISP but I hate the seating policy so much that for my upcoming trip I will fly into JFK and take a shuttle. SW likes to say that its seating policy is freedom of choice choose any seat you want but that is not true. There is a hierarchy for seating which they charge extra for and then after paying all these extra fees you could still wind up with a lousy seat. We paid extra and were able to snag bulkhead but not exit row for the first leg of our trip because those were taken by mostly short people who don't need the leg room but who had boarded first. Then we had to change planes. Unfortunately the connecting flight originated from somewhere else and the plane was already half full so not only could we not get any leg room but we couldn't even sit together. Paying extra for better boarding is like playing roulette you take your chances and the odds are against you. I'd rather pay extra to choose my seat and know that it is guaranteed. The whole boarding process is so stressful because some people are pushing to get ahead of other people and everyone is rushing to grab the seat they want not knowing if they are going to be out of luck or not. Then after you get your seat the flight attendants are trying to get people to volunteer to give it up so a family can sit together. The whole thing is absurd. On top of all of this their prices are often not the lowest. I can fly into JFK pay extra for premium seating and afford a shuttle for what a Southwest flight to ISP costs.,7/17/2014,2,2,0,NaN,4,NaN
Andrea Lemmon,1,Recently flew in economy from Istanbul to Gatwick with Turkish Airlines. The flight was terrific with prompt boarding good service and on-time arrival. The highlight of the flight was the standard of food offered in economy. We were very pleasantly surprised with the quality and quantity of food and wine offered. The Turkish delight that the staff handed out was a forerunner to a really delightful meal. Would recommend this airline.,5/31/2015,5,4,5,4,5,9
Alan Tang,1,Took return flight from Sydney to Hobart and really enjoyed the trip. The price was very reasonable and the cabin staff were very professional and friendly. Check-in process was quick and easy. I will definitely recommend flying Virgin Australia as the service has improved a lot since my last flight with them in 2011.,5/19/2013,5,5,3,3,5,8
Andrea Pastorelli,1,Milan-NY JFK - I recently flew A330 from Milan to New York JFK in economy class and the flight was extremely good. The plane was clean and brand new the seats very spacious and comfortable. Most importantly the in-flight entertainment was the best I have ever had in economy on any airline. The screen is very large and the selection of movies is very impressive. Food was better than most economy flights as well. They even gave us ice cream mid-flight and plenty of drinks. Very nice touches. Overall this was the best economy class flight I have ever taken. Alitalia has improved so much they deserve a new reputation now.,10/8/2012,5,5,4,4,5,10
A Robinson,0,Flew to Orlando with Virgin in April this year in one of their old Jumbos. Seating was very cramped and not very comfortable at all yes I know I was in economy but I've been flying for years and I really think they ought to replace the old 747s. Flight was delayed 24 hours on the way home! We were told it was due to weather / ground staff at Palm Beach where the plane had to land first! I thought this was rubbish especially when we found out the plane the day before was also delayed 24 hours. We are going to Las Vegas next year and have no intentions of using Virgin then or ever again.,9/19/2014,1,1,2,3,2,2
Alan Tang,1,KL1602 (FCO-AMS): I would describe the whole experience as efficient yet comfortable. As this is a short flight (2 hours) the crew managed to make the flight pleasant. The service was offered twice the first with sandwich with cheese and selection of drinks (hot beverages and soft drinks) and followed with tea and coffee with biscuits. Crew were nice and helpful for the full flight and noticed how they are really aware on recycling meal packaging after meal service was completed. Totally recommend KLM for the regional Europe flights as they have managed to make the flight comfortable and seamless.,11/25/2014,3,3,4,1,4,8
Andrea Scheinflug,0,Flight from BCN-HAJ on 4th of May. Flight was delayed several times and finally cancelled in the afternoon. According to Vueling due to fog (which was there in the morning but had already cleared up until midday). No information or assistance from Vueling staff at all. Had to get back our already checked-in luggage which took another 1.5 hours. In the queue were approx. 1000 other people (several flights were cancelled that day by Vueling) and only 1 staff member from Vueling behind the counter. Could not help us at all. Next flight to Hanover with free seats could be offered only 3 (!) days later. So we also had to re-organize our flight home with another airline and spent one more night in Barcelona at our own cost. No offers from Vueling not even an excuse.,6/6/2015,0,1,0,1,1,NaN
A Rochard,0,YYZ-AMS-YYZ. Legroom was okay got the exit row on the way back. Food decent for a charter. Seat width normal (unlike Air Transat they don't squeeze an extra row of seats in). I didn't feel the need to upgrade to Economy plus. The personal entertainment device (portable hard drive with monitor) was great. Worth the 12 euro on the day flight back.,11/6/2008,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,4
Alan Thompson,1,London to Bari via Rome Bari to London via Milan. Very good experience airline is consistently improving. Online check-in now available when travelling with children making baggage drop at Heathrow very easy and quick. Planes clean and modern drinks fine snack just adequate (similar to BA in Europe now). Prices were good and arrivals near enough on time.,6/18/2012,5,5,3,4,4,8
Andrea Taylor,0,"We arrived at the airport 3 hours early to beat the LA traffic. We had our seats prior and had to pay a 100 dollar fee for our bags, one each. When it was time to board we got in line and waited 15 minutes while the attendant helped a woman figure out her purchase. We asked a couple of times if we can board but we're ignored. Finally the attendant said we missed the flight and would not be refunded. I was shocked and asked when the next flight out was and was told not until the next day. I asked for a refund was told no but finally was granted one after ranting and raving. I asked why he didn't stop to help us when I clearly said we were waiting for the flight. He
said he called our names, we were there and didn't hear a thing. We went to JetBlue and they took good care of us.",6/16/2015,1,1,1,1,1,1
A Roman,0,Quality worsened significantly since last time. Month ago I had a flight to London - it was OK. My recent flight was Kiev-Rome-Kiev. Flight from Kiev delayed 50 mins without any explanations or excuses. Flight duration - around 3 hours. Only provided with snack - one sandwich (poor) and tea without lemon. Return from Rome - once again 1 hour delay. Service quality can not be compared even with low-cost air company. Awful!,5/6/2013,1,3,1,0,2,NaN
A Lanzaga,0,I flew several Times with Zest MNL either to TAG an CEB. My flights were never on time and very poor customer service at all stations.

Alan Thompson,1,London Gatwick to Bari. Out on 15 Feb flight over 3 hours late. Sent to distant gate for an on-time takeoff where the flight was not even displayed. No information all afternoon and nobody to ask Kept in-touch via Easyjet website. Panic amongst passengers when flight suddenly displayed as 'Gate Closed'. Terrible customer service non- existent. Flight crew lovely. Return flight on time and up to standard of low cost carrier.,2/21/2014,4,2,3,NaN,3,6
A Ross,1,LGW-MAD-GRU - Having done this journey direct from the UK I was dubious about the change in Madrid and sceptical about the Â£2k less difference in the BA price. Check was a bit gruff at Gatwick with the handling agents doing their best to ignore customers while discussing their weekend plans and gossiping about a poor member of staff who had just gone of shift . However the Lounges at Gatwick and Madrid were not as good as the Heathrow Terraces but much better than the rude and over booked facilities of the JFK Terraces. I felt the weak link here was the lounge in Sao Paulo on the way back which reminded me of a provincial airport with basic service and low quality decor. Air Europa may wish to consider changing this. The first thing that strikes you about this airline is the service and the pristine staff who respond to you every need as if their life depended on it  nothing was too much trouble. Dinner service was on a par with old BA first class with leather menus and five courses although the food was on a par with lesser Club World. The seat - was not a lie flat bed but very similar to Club World London City although the Air Europa Corporate colours are a bit garish for my taste. There were plenty of films to watch and an I pad if you ran out the regular on demand service. There was a the obligatory amenity kit comforter blanket and pillows at bed time. I cannot understand why the cabin was half empty! If I were considering another trip to South America I would seriously consider using Air Europa again - especially given the saving.,2/11/2015,5,4,4,4,5,9
Andreas Becker,1,HAM-DXB-HAM with B777. As always EK flight was fairly pleasant even when both flights have been packed. Entertainment system is second to none space and food better than with all European airlines. Service good both flights have been more or less in time. Check in procedure efficient. Unfortunately this time it happens to me that the stewardess spilled some coffee over my sweater. She felt very embarrassed and apologised with champagne from biz class.,1/17/2014,4,4,4,5,4,8
A Lawes,0,"We have just travelled to Hawaii on Jetstar and it was a nightmare from the start. At Melbourne airport we waited almost 2 hours at the check-in desk even though we had done ""so called online check in"". When I told the girl at the desk she told me I was lucky - some people wait 3 hours. Then we waited almost 2 hours on board to get anything to eat or drink because we had not paid the outrageous fee for meals! Since being in Hawaii I have spoken to several of my compatriots who swear they will never travel Jetstar again. Personally I am dreading the return trip to Melbourne on Friday morning. So much for Qantas Frequent Flyer card which I have had for 20 years. A very dissatisfied customer.",9/1/2014,1,3,3,1,2,NaN
Alan Traves,0,"Flight LHR-HEL-HKG and return. The flight to Helsinki was fine but the onwards flight to Hong Kong was a nightmare. The flight attendants looked like SS guards and acted similarly. Although there was some turbulence passengers were restrained from going to the toilets making for a great deal of discomfort. On arriving in Hong Kong things got worse. Those of us who arrived from London had no luggage and the lost luggage clerk told us ""that is not the second time this has happened this week"". Further enquiry confirmed it to be the third time. While the luggage did turn up a couple of days later this was a huge inconvenience and Finnair did not even bother answering our complaint. The return trip was staffed by similarly surly flight attendants so it too was less than an enjoyable experience. 1/10 based on the fact we arrived safely. The attitude of staff and their total lack of courtesy over the luggage merits the low score.",9/17/2014,2,3,3,3,1,1
Andreas HÃ¸le,1,SK942 Airbus A340-300 ORD-CPH October 9th 2012. We arrived with American Airlines from LAX and landed at O'Hare 30 mins before the SAS departure. We arrived at the gate 10 mins before departure and boarded with no rush. We were pushed from the Gate 5 mins late and was airborne 10 mins thereafter. The whole experience was excellent except the seats in economy class - hard and uncomfortable and need an upgrade.,1/8/2013,5,3,4,4,5,9
A Leal,0,I was on the inaugural flight to Buenos Aires from JFK and while the service at the airport was great and went through without any hitches the service on the flight was horrible. The flight attendants had such a bad attitude and passengers flicked on the service light for the entire flight and not once did I see someone respond. They basically served dinner and then left the cabin for the entire time until breakfast. I was dehydrated and not feeling well and wanted some water and didn't see anyone come so being that I was in the window seat I flicked the service light and after an hour of waiting I finally went to look for someone all the way at the back of the plane and they were all sleeping (it was 7pm). It was such a bad service experience that I will sadly never fly again and recommend that no one else fly either. You have one chance to make an impression and they really blew it with me.,12/31/2013,2,4,4,4,1,3
Alan Wan,1,LHR to NRT : I was impressed the service was similar standards to SIA. Attentive friendly and with the important small touches like hot towels. Dinner one of the best economy meals I have had in a long time - I was not in a mood to drink alcohol so canot comment on the choice or quality. I slept for most of the flight and the IFE (although a decent system) choice of films was rather limited.,1/10/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
A Rowell,0,LAX to San Jose Costa Rica with a layover in Ft. Lauderdale. The worst experience on all fronts. Checked-in at the counter as I wasn't sure if my bag was one that I would have to pay for. He told me that as long as I put my purse in my carry-on and only had one item I would be fine. I showed him my bag and he confirmed that I would not be charged for it. However when boarding in Ft. Lauderdale I was stopped by one of their employees who asked me if I paid for my bag. I told her no she asked me if I had used the overhead compartment on my way there and I said yes. She informed me that if I planned to use an overhead bin then I would need to pay them $100 immediately or I would not be able to bring my bag on my flight. I ended up paying the $100 in order to board my flight and I was made to feel like the whole thing was my fault - it was terrible. On the way back home my friend and I decided to go online the night before as we were told that if we pay online we only have to pay $30. When we went to pay their website told us that we were not eligible to make payments at that time. So we still ended up having to pay $50 at the airport check in. Even if that baggage fiasco hadn't happen this flight still would have been awful. The seats are the airline equivalent of plastic picnic chairs and you have to pay for water (even if your flight is 5hrs long). Coming home from San Jose after going through security my friend decided to fill her plastic water bottle so that she could have a little for the flight. Before boarding they announced that they were going to re-search our bags and that we would have to dump out all liquids that we were carrying my friend didn't think that they would actually prevent her from bringing airport water on to the flight but when they checked her bag they told her she either had to dump it or chug it. She chugged it. It is clear that every thing Spirit does is an extra attempt to take more money from you. I understand that they offer affordable flights but it is not worth all of the extra out-of-pocket cash and stress that they cause. I will never fly with them again.,9/17/2014,2,1,1,1,1,1
Andreas Imboden,0,Male-Colombo. Business Class was simple no entertainment system but seats comfortable. However after take-off they let some kid (screening in excitement) from economy class run up and down the aisle which was bothering. Stewardess did not respond to my request and let the kid continue for the entire flight.,4/7/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,1
Alan Wan,1,London Heathrow to Pristina via Zagreb return. Online check-in was difficult from London. It allowed me to choose my seat then the on-line process failed. On my return on-line check was not available then again it was not available for BA and Swiss who I have used on this route. For a European short haul airline the onboard service was excellent. FA's were friendly and the food good. The longer sector from LHR-ZAG return included a proper cold meal. A full and free bar service. Even on short sector ZAG-PRN included a sandwich and bar. This is welcome given the poor availability of food to purchase at PRN and ZAG. Also the tight transfer time at ZAG restricts any opportunity to purchase food/beverage. The only problem I have with Croatia Airlines is the transfer at Zagreb as the airport is a joke and the tight transfer can be stressful due to slow security processing.,3/22/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Ledgerwood,0,After repeated late and canceled flights I will no longer fly Frontier. Their ticket prices are cheaper but if you can't reach your final destination (like I was unable to) then it ends up costing you more in the long run. After a delayed 3 hour flight and missing my connection I was forced to cancel my trip to Vegas since I couldn't get on another flight for another day and a half! I have never flown on a Frontier flight that has arrived on time yet. Will not use again.,1/19/2015,2,3,3,2,3,NaN
Andreas Kronenberg,0,American Eagle is a poor choice of transportation and you should consider alternatives. I arrived at the airport from another flight and waited for 3 hours for my flight. Upon arriving at the airport I checked the boards to double-check that my flight would take off at the same gate as listed on my boarding pass. However when the time came my flight wasn't listed. Upon asking about the flight I was informed that they had changed gates (from B21 to B9 far from my location). However they did not announce any gate changes. I was informed that they don't announce gate changes unless it's less the change is made in the last two hours. Thus I waited 3 hours (with false information) and missed my flight. I had to stay the night in Dallas and fly standby the next morning. Why would an airline consider a policy of not announcing important gate changes?,6/5/2014,1,1,1,1,1,NaN
A Rugh,0,There were 5 of us traveling Los Angeles - Newark - Copenhagen. The flight on SAS from Newark to Copenhagen cancelled but we were not notified. We were rescheduled on Swiss Air from Newark through Zurich to Copenhagen. When we asked about our checked bags in Newark SAS didn't have a clue where they were. We ultimately found all of our bags sitting in lost and found in Newark. I would think SAS would have a system set to make sure that checked bags are also re-routed along with the passenger. On our return from Copenhagen on SAS the crew kept the cabin lighting on full bright the entire trip. It made it difficult to view the video screen and with many families with children I felt if the lighting were turned lower it would have been a more calming atmosphere because there truly was no rest on that trip. In the future I would probably try to find another airline rather than fly SAS.,8/28/2012,3,3,3,4,4,2
Alan Ward,1,I flew from Singapore to Jakarta on May 14th and opted for the Red Carpet Service paying S$55 for the extra service. I thought check in was efficient but it turns out I should have been given lounge access but this didn't happen so I bought breakfast. I guess the priority boarding was good but I'd had to pay extra for my seat allocation as well. The flight was good with friendly and helpful crew and regular updates from the flight deck. I'm flying back to Singapore on May 22nd from Jakarta and look forward to a good flight in seat 1A.,5/19/2013,4,4,4,0,5,8
A Leger,1,AC835 YUL to GVA January 21st 2015 Airbus A330 seat 38D. Not a very full flight so I was able to sleep on four empty seats.

Andreas Zuschke,1,LH 419 IAD-FRA in Boeing 747-8. The Crew was friendly and the service good. The aircraft was immaculate. I booked a seat with extra legroom at an extra cost of 60â‚¬.

Alan Ward,1,Cardiff - Singapore: May 10th/11th - Business Class. For various reasons I was unable to book this flight until the day of travel so it was an expensive flight but my phone reservation was handled promptly and efficiently. Check in at Cardiff was smooth and the lounge offered a selection of Welsh drinks. There was priority boarding onto the old F-70 which was not full and only 2 in business class. The aircraft looked like it had recently been refurbished. A smooth but short transfer at Schipol into 1J on B777-300ER where pre-take off drinks were offered. The whole flight was good although my AV didn't work for the first two hours. It was my birthday the next morning so I was woken with a champagne breakfast. Great crew.,5/12/2013,3,4,4,4,5,10
A Leibowitz,1,Business/First from JFK-POS POS POS-GEO-JFK. Their lounges are basic. Flight left on time. Their 737-800 business class is pretty standard. Leg room in Business is just alright but considering the size of the plane acceptable. Food and service was good as usual FA's are personable and professional. It has always been my experience that CA tends to run out of popular dishes very quickly kind of sad when business class is not that big. Return flight on their brand new 767-300er departed 90 minutes late the reason why is still a mystery to me. On board nice roomy plane no complaints on leg room here. The seats were nice enough they did lay flat however they did seem to go for very basic business class e.g. inflight entertainment was there but not usable and power at seat didn't work. I ran into a really big issue with my seat tray - during food service it completely fell apart and separated from the swing arm and could not be reattached. It was a very full flight but fortunately there was one empty seat the FA's quickly made accommodations for me. Overall I would say it was sufficient.,4/2/2013,4,4,4,2,4,6
Andres Baboun,0,September 6 2013 Business Class from Frankfurt to Santiago via Sao Paulo. Airplane 777 fairly new. FA's make you feel they were doing you a favor bringing you food. Very cold service attitude and sometimes rude. They expected everyone to speak Portuguese. Plane in this section had 3 bathroom one was kept locked only for FA's to use. They did not care there was a line and still kept the bathroom closed. Food was ok nothing special. Inflight entertainment had a poor selection of films. Chaotic boarding in SAO.,9/12/2013,4,3,4,4,2,7
A Ryerson,0,"Just added Delta to the airlines that I will never fly again. American was the only one with that recognition previously. Booked flight for two from Des Moines to San Francisco and return. Outgoing flight was as planned and no problems. Noticed when I checked in the day before flight that return connection from Minneapolis to DSM had gone from 1 hour to 3+ hour layover. Just tried to change departure time from SFO to Minneapolis so flight would make more sense (1 hour layover). Said they would be happy to for $235! I make sane rationale reservations with ""standard"" layovers and airline changes (or cancels) a flight doesn't inform me and after I learn about it and try to make sense of the booking again they are happy to change for additional $$$.

A Sabean,1,We travelled Canjet from Halifax to Holguin Cuba March 15-22 2014. The check in people we encountered in Halifax were not friendly at all downstairs or upstairs when boarding the plane. The lines were very slow moving. It would be nice if we could have done web check in online or with the machines before checking in at the desk. It would have saved a lot of time. We were very surprised that the seats on the plane were actually quite comfortable and didn't lean back too far like some planes we've been on. They served us a complimentary hot meal champagne and wine along with soft drinks juices etc. This was all very nice. The crew left a lot to be desired as it was hard to even get a smile out of most of them. We will add that we sat in the very back of the plane on the trip home and had actually paid for seat selection for those seats so we could snuggle in and sleep during the overnight flight - the bathroom at the rear of the plane on the return flight smelt horrible - as soon as we entered the plane and any time the door was opened etc. Overall we were pleased with Canjet - Just a few more friendly staff would be a great asset.,4/3/2014,4,4,4,3,3,7
Al-Ani Ayad,0,Degrading the Business Class experience at the new airport in Doha and Business Class passengers will no longer have automatic access to lounges at departure and transfer - I know of no other airline doing this. Under the old regime Business Class passengers regardless of their loyalty status benefited from a separate terminal that provided a very good seating area separate check in and boarding facilities. At the new airport this is currently not available and no lounge access to all Business Class passengers. Lounge is only accessible if you are a gold or silver card holder even if you paid a full price business class ticket. They indicated however that you would be able to access the lounge by the way of paying an extra fee! Flight experience on the other hand was fine. Crew is very good. Entertainment systems breaks down and needs to be restarted. New seats are very good too.,6/12/2014,1,5,3,3,5,4
A Lever,0,Return flight March 12th flight 1119 from Las Vegas to Toronto. Then supposed to be on Flight 358 from Toronto to Ottawa at 8am but ended up on a 2pm flight to Ottawa instead. Terrible experience. Our first flight was delayed 2.5 hours so before we even left we knew we'd miss our connection. The rep told us not to book the next flight as they would hold the plane for us as there were many in the same boat. They didn't. We got stuck waiting another 5 hours even though there were many other carriers with flights they could have put us on. We were told to go to customer service to be first in line for standby. We did and they told us to check back every 15 minutes. We did. There ended up being 2 spots on an earlier flight that they gave to someone who happened to just walk up to the gate. When we asked why we didn't get those seats we were told nobody told them we were waiting. We were told lie after lie by 4 different reps. Will not fly WestJet again!,3/17/2014,3,1,0,1,1,NaN
Andrew Albanese,1,Used Asiana Club points for a trip from Sydney to London return in business. Daytime flight from Sydney to Seoul then another daytime flight the following day to London. Overnight hotel provided at the Hyatt Regency was excellent. Return flights were faster though less appealing with 2 overnight flights with a good connection in Seoul. Check-in process on all legs were efficient and check-in staff very friendly and welcoming. Lounge in Incheon was an elegant space with good hot and cold food. First and last legs were in the older 777 models and I found the angled seat very comfortable with sufficient width and space. Very comfortable flat seats and offered plenty of room and storage space. On all legs meals were served up beautifully. Impressed by their selection of quality champagne wines and whisky. On top of main meals snacks were served. IFE was much better on the newer aircraft with plenty more movies and even wider screens. Amenity kit contained branded products and extra amenities such as combs toothbrushes cologne and facial sprays were available as needed in the lavatories. Outstanding service from the crew and both hard and soft products are among the best.,3/30/2013,5,5,5,5,5,10
Alasdair Brooks,1,DXB - IAD [Washington DC] in January 2015 economy class. Given the only choice on this direct route is either Emirates or United it's not really much in the way of competition - give me Emirates every time. Emirates has an excellent on-demand in-flight entertainment system decent food efficient multi-lingual staff amenity packs in economy on long-haul flights and all drinks except champagne are complementary in economy. No one really wants to be stuck on a plane for 15 hours but it's on these really long routes that the little extras on Emirates - especially the in-flight entertainment system and power outlets for every seat - come into their own.,1/23/2015,4,4,4,5,4,9
A Lewis,1,Travelled to UK/Europe with very few complaints. Very first flight delayed 5 hours meaning we missed our connection in Ho Chi Minh but that was because of a typhoon and although it was a little chaotic when we arrived the airline put us up in a lovely hotel and paid all our meals until we left the following night. Yes the seating is a little cramped the meals average the entertainment system a bit hit and miss but all flight staff seem friendly and helpful and the price was great.,5/20/2012,4,4,4,4,4,8
A Sahni,1,DFW to Milan Italy via JFK in December 2014. On check in for this flight at DFW the agent informs us the flight is over sold in economy so we inquire about being switched to British Airways on the non-stop to LHR then on-wards to Milan. The AA Agent looks puzzled and quickly said we cannot switch you to BA. At this point we are confused as AA/BA have a tie up we know for a fact Delta can put you on Air France if the flight is over sold. So then we head to JFK with the domestic leg good on a new plane. At the AA terminal 8 at JFK we come to find out the AA lounge coupons given to use are no good but the AA Agent in the lounge makes an exception for the lounge since Christmas is around the corner. Finally we board the AA flight to Milan. Since we own the AA credit card we are allowed to board with Zone 2 but the red jacket agent stops us saying your AA Credit Card is useless and does not work for zone 2. Finally get on the flight and the flight leaves on time. Meals and service were good as AA has to compete with Emirates on this sector but AA really lacks any economy class in flight entertainment. There are no personal TV screens in each seat like Emirates offers. The seats in economy class are too small on AA. Since AA has put TV screens every few rows no one can sleep on this flight as the lighting from the TV screens is very annoying. To end the flight the Breakfast was very good in economy. Overall if AA would match Emirates with proper in flight offering in economy class they would have a good product but till they do this one is better offer taking Emirates if flying to Milan in Economy class.,1/23/2015,3,2,5,1,5,5
Andrew Barnes,1,Quick and friendly service. Seats very comfortable for a budget airline. Have flown with them several times and never had a problem. The cabin staff are always friendly and helpful.,7/9/2015,5,5,2,NaN,5,8
A Liberman,1,I flew Air Canada from BOS-YYZ on 8/20/14 in economy class. FA's were friendly and the seats were very comfortable. Not that many movie choices but it is a short flight. On the way back there was a problem with my name during boarding (probably because I was an unaccompanied minor) and as an apology I got a free business class upgrade. The food was great and the seats were very nice. I recommend it.,8/28/2014,4,4,5,3,4,8
Alasdair Dawson,0,"Comfort plus is nearly worth the upgrade fee - seat is still poor but leg room is good. Baggage delayed by more than 48 hours with the most insincere of apologies from the online folks. The staff, however, were great.",7/8/2015,2,1,3,3,3,1
Andrew Bratt,1,Traveled business class between Bangkok and Colombo twice in last month principally because it is the cheaper than Thai or MAS. Terrible departure times 23.05 from Bangkok and even worse 02.25 from Colombo. Cathay now flies A330 instead of Boeing 777 which I think was better. Seat in capsule format very uncomfortable with recline minimal. In fully reclined position can't fully extend your legs. Three hour flight was just about tolerable. I wouldn't go for anything longer. Service on board is in a hurry to get things over as quickly as possible. Wine bought to you seat in a glass rather than bottle. Not impressed: Meals pretty mediocre. Cathay used to be amongst the best but all these airlines are being eclipsed by the Middle East carriers.,1/19/2015,5,2,2,3,2,5
Alastair Birkett,1,KL to London on A380 in business class. This was sadly the last of my 4 flights on my Malaysia/Australia holiday. I started by holiday on an A380 in business from London to KL and what a great way to finish! I can honestly say that out of all the airlines that I have flown with in business class Malaysia beats the competition hands down. The A380 experience in business class is just fantastic. None of my 4 flights disappointed.,1/14/2014,5,5,5,5,5,10
A Salter,0,Shanghai to Melbourne. The food was awful I asked for a vegetarian meal and the first one was re-heated dried up veggies. The 2nd dinner was a repeat heating of the same. Staff infrequently offered water tea or coffee. The headsets were faulty - full of static. The seats were uncomfortable. Left on the tarmac for 2 hours from Shanghai to Beijing without explanation other than it was a traffic hold-up - we later learned an earlier flight had similar delays.,6/6/2013,1,1,1,3,2,NaN
A Licht,1,Helsinki - Istanbul - Cape Town. Service and food in economy were great in modern day standards. Multi-course dinner with wine and spirits served even on the 3-hour Helsinki-Istanbul -flight. Seats were common narrow economy seats and not that comfortable for longer flights leg room quite poor. FA's were mostly bit robotic and busy but also friendly every now and then. Nice touch with the amenity kits and slippers on the long flight to South Africa. Good value for money.,1/5/2015,5,3,4,4,3,8
Andrew Carfrae,0,HKG-HEL then back through Bangkok in economy. Flight was okay staff were very icy (except for one nice FA) and connections were good. Flight time to Europe for Australians is lessened so another good thing. Food was reasonably dire and drinks expensive. Not sure I would go with them again.,4/26/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,5
Alastair Finch,1,Again a mixed experience with Emirates EK407 MEL-DUB and EK017 DXB-MAN business class both on A380. Business seat would be tight for a large person cabin crew patchy on night flight from MEL. Food wise advertised items like cheese and coffee had to be specifically requested rather than routinely provided plane from Melbourne was an hour late in to Dubai resulting in a frantic dash over a long distance to Manchester. Plane service and food better on day service.,11/25/2014,5,3,4,5,3,7
Andrew Coogans,1,"Once boarded there was a technical fault with air conditioning and the cabin got very hot. The cabin crew did offer cold water to keep all passengers cool, and delay was only around 20 minutes. Once airborne, drinks and snacks were served. Seating on A319 was comfortable for a short flight. At GLA Airport the parking stands  are so far away from the main terminal and pick up points, and changes to the airport in the past couple of years have increased the walking distance. This is annoying if you only have hand luggage and want a quick getaway, especially on a late night arrival. One sees Easyjet and Ryanair passengers passing through the arrivals process much quicker.",6/26/2015,4,5,3,NaN,5,8
A Sanghvi,0,BOM-DEL and IXB-KOL. Both flights were heavily delayed. Was the worst Indian airline in terms of punctuality and service. Also they seem to get the furthest possible bays which means taking almost an hour from the plane to the airport after landing. I would not fly with them again.,11/7/2008,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,2
A Lim,1,Round trip MNL-YVR via stopover at TPE. They seem to have done a major overhaul of their operating procedures and got their act together consistently for several years now. Their aircraft appeared to be in good to excellent condition and to the credit of the pilots involved those four landings were among the smoothest I've experienced in years. This airline may not be the best but I consider them to be very good. Fares are reasonable and given the level of service I received was good value for money.,2/25/2013,4,4,4,4,4,9
Alastair Finch,1,Have flown several times with this airline recently Perth to Adelaide and Alice Springs to Sydney business class and Canberra to Melbourne economy. My wife and I were very impressed staff were brilliant and the business class food on both flights was exceellent. Seats were comfy and entertainment very good. The economy flight was only a short one but the leg room was good and the staff were excellent much older plane with overhead seats only.,11/20/2014,4,4,5,4,4,9
A Santos,0,MNL-SEA and LAS-MNL. Overall a disappointing experience and we won't make the mistake of booking it again. It was really like taking a domestic US flight across the Pacific when there are so many options on international airlines. The service amenities and aircraft are not comparable. Manila check-in was ok but they had problems with non-working printers and were unable to print all of our boarding passes (they told us to just pick up the last one in HNL because they couldn't figure it out). We boarded the 20+ year-old 767 with overhead bins sized from the 80's no IFE and ageing cabin. The flight attendants all appeared to be senior and had a lot of attitude. We overheard one flight attendant insult an elderly passenger behind her back because the passenger requested to change her new blanket which had hairs on it. The mocking and poor attitude of flight attendants which other reviewers below referred to was true on our flight. To watch movies they rented personal DVD players for $15 per segment. With a change of plane in HNL that meant 4 segments round-trip or $60 per person to watch movies. When we inquired if there was a seafood option (the only choices were chicken and pork) the flight attendant replied they used to have special meals but no longer offer them. On the return flight from LAS we stopped over in HNL for a night but were charged baggage fees for that segment because it was technically a domestic flight - $25 per bag. Finally we took off from HNL-MNL and weren't in the air for 30 minutes when the captain announced a faulty generator requiring us to return to HNL (again a 20+ year-old 767). However we had to burn fuel first so we flew in circles at 7000 ft for 4 hours with the landing gear and flaps fully extended - an uncomfortable ride. The flight attendants were plain combative with understandably worried and upset passengers. Six hours later we landed in HNL again. They arranged another plane with a new crew and we arrived in MNL 8 hours late. To make matters worse they left behind baggage of at least 50 passengers in HNL so there was an ugly queue of irate passengers at 2:30 am after an 8 hour delay. We received our luggage two days later. We wrote a letter to Hawaiian but they did not respond. All in all if we had flown on CX or KE or OZ via HKG or SEL to the mainland we could've avoided a tremendous amount of hassle (eg. having to collect your bags and check-in again in HNL) being nickel and dimed (eg. luggage fees and DVD rental fees) poor service (being insulted by flight attendant) and delays from old faulty aircraft. I should also mention I felt bad for the business class passengers who paid $2000+ for their seats. The seats in business class are domestic US first class seats - very little recline and leg room. You have many choices and until Hawaiian actually starts caring about their transpacific passengers we are not flying them again.,5/18/2010,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
Andrew Coogans,1,"Created my own ""connection"" via Dublin to get from Glasgow to Bremen. Excellent value and only travelled with cabin baggage. Due to the time of year I assumed the flights would be busy so asked at the Bag Drop desks at both Glasgow and Dublin if they could accept by bag into the hold, which they did free of charge and with no fuss. GLA-DUB flight was slightly late due to the aircraft arriving late into Glasgow, but the next sector was on time, arriving 10 minutes early. Both flights typical Ryanair, the service being consistent. Crew on the DUB-BRE sector had more time to chat and appeared efficient. Bags arrived on time at each airport and pre-booked seats worked well. I like the calmer boarding atmosphere that allocated seating brings.",6/28/2015,5,5,NaN,NaN,5,10

Albany Wong,1,"Flew Melbourne to Bangkok return in economy. Melbourne to Bangkok: Hot towels were given out after take off, a drinks round and then dinner was served. Food was decent for economy class. Good choice of inflight entertainment.  Cabin crew were polite and friendly and did their jobs to a high standard. Drinks offered many times by staff, and drinks were available in the galley as well. Breakfast served before landing. Bangkok to Melbourne: Much the same as the in bound flight, crew excellent and several drink rounds were offered.

Andrew Craig,1,Flew them on the Frankfurt - Sarajevo trip on board their B737. I found the airline staff professional and friendly which can't be said about the customs at SJJ airport most of whom looked downright angry and like they hate their job.

A Lindley,1,I had booked a return trip from LGW to WHK - about 2 weeks before my scheduled departure from Gatwick I stumbled across information (by chance!) on the internet that Air Namibia had axed all its flights from Gatwick. They never informed me of it at all (later I found out it was because I had booked directly with the airline on its website rather than with a travel agent. People who booked directly with the airline received no information apparently). So I phoned their representatives (who were still active in London). The agent who took my call was very helpful though - she rescheduled my flight without issues with BA via Frankfurt. She had also assured me that I could check my bags straight through from Heathrow to Windhoek. Of course this ended up not being the case. The lady at the BA counter at Heathrow knew of no such cooperation with Air Namibia. She said I had to re-check the bags in at Frankfurt. I didn't mind though. Otherwise my flights were on time and I got to Windhoek without any other hassle. The return journey was flawless - bags checked through all the way to Heathrow from Windhoek via Frankfurt. I would fly them again.,1/6/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,6
Albert Crane,0,Travelled to Cuba 30 Dec returned 13 Jan. No movie enroute plus no headsets to listen to on return miscount of babies and were delayed almost an hour while recount was done. The smoked meat was horrible couldn't eat it. I had paid for the Elite plus package and the stewardess wanted $3 for the headset on the return because she had informed that they were not free anymore even after I had questioned it because I was entitled to them with the elite package and what first run movies. To make things worst I paid $200 extra for this package when a passenger sitting next to me had his family of five sitting in the preferred seats at no extra cost to him. If this isn't false advertisement what is.,1/19/2015,3,3,2,1,3,5
A Lloyd,1,Flight to Sanford in premium seating even though Dreamliner was only one year old it had dirty seats and crumbs in crevices and overall looked like it hadn't been cleaned properly for a while. Shame as overall the Dreamliner comfort levels and room were great. Two man crew never smiled during service and didn't stop economy passengers using the premium toilets causing queues to form which shouldn't happen when paying additional Â£250 per person for the extra service.,10/5/2014,3,4,3,5,2,8
Albert McCarthy,1,Travelled from London Heathrow to Bangkok (Business Class). From arriving at check in to leaving at Bangkok I must say this is the best airline I have travelled with.

Andrew Denley,1,Gatwick to Funchal and back May 2012. Overall impression very good. Online check-in was quick and easy. Flights each way were on time. Aircraft was clean and there was more leg-room than some holiday carriers I've flown with. Flight attendants were polite. Refreshments very basic - really just a make-it-yourself cheese and ham roll and a cup of tea or coffee. No re-fills. Announcements in Portuguese and then English. Would fly again with TAP and most definitely in preference to Easyjet!,5/10/2012,4,5,3,0,4,8

Alberto Garcia,0,Last January 13th I took my flight back from Madrid Spain to JFK AA 095 we started our flight two hours late not being informed about time or anything similar we were not allowed to leave the area inside the airport where our plane was and if we wanted they said that they would open our carry-on bags totally. We boarded and when we were boarding they informed us that we had a stop in Goose bay Canada to have gas otherwise we would not be able to get to New York the stop was 1h 30m long. We arrive in JFK so late that almost everybody lost their connection. However we were given new connections once we got out of the plane. But they did not give us any voucher or anything in compensation for this horrible flight. I would try not to fly American Airlines again.,1/19/2015,1,2,2,1,3,1
Andrew Dixon,0,STN-GGN-STN. Outward flight faultless. Swift check-in a breeze through security prompt boarding and an on- time departure. Crew friendly and efficient and seats comfortable (paid for Best Seats at front of cabin). Got off the flight thinking this was a good airline. But return flight a completely different story. Got to boarding gate at CGN to be told flight delayed for 20 mins 3 hrs later we were still there! Information from staff appalling. Finally boarded another aircraft with the rudest crew I've ever met who huffed and puffed from boarding to landing. Despite the delay no offer of refreshments. Out and home was like flying with 2 completely different airlines.,6/30/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,4
A Loppe,1,Regina to Montego Bay Jamaica return. The flights were on time in fact a few minutes early both ways the staff and crew were friendly and professional.

Alberto Robayo,0,Is Southwest becoming too big? It used to be one of the few airlines I could rely on for great customer service and quality. But it seems that with the acquisition of Airtran they also acquired the bad habits of big airlines. My last trip with them was a headache that cost me $500. I got stuck in Chicago for one night and received attitude from the crew when I tried to address the issue. It is great that they don't charge for luggage but I'm curious to see how long that is going to last.,5/16/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,1
A Saraiva,0,"I fly with TAP about 5-6 times a year mainly on the Lisboa - London route. One of my main issues with them is their ground handling ""Groundforce"" in Lisboa. The flight information screens are not always updated or accurate and the check-in area is always overcrowded and disorganized! To make matters worse many of the check-in and gate agents are unprofessional and rude. Last week we were kept 15min inside a hot bus before it was dispatched to the aircraft. When we arrived at the aircraft a further 10min wait before the doors were open. The flight was over an hour late and the all male cabin crew looked scruffy and had a bad attitude!",11/6/2013,2,3,2,1,1,2
Andrew Duff,0,LGW-AGP and back. 737-400s on both journeys. These aircraft are looking very tatty now - seats worn cabins grimy and dingy. The 'food' was a soggy half-wrap with a filling-free miniature roll - it was unacceptable on a 2hr45m flight. No choice offered by the cabin crew even though they had 3 options. The claim that their food offering is appropriate to the time of day is hogwash - we were served exactly the same thing at 10.30am on the outbound flight as at midnight on the return. Although we benefited from it on this trip BA need to change their hand luggage policy. There simply isn't space for 150+ passengers to bring 2 bags which caused a lot of angst particularly on the return trip (both flights were completely full). On the upside both flights were on time and the crews were friendly - the return crew dealt well with a potentially disruptive family group.,10/22/2014,4,2,1,1,3,5
A Lowe,0,Flight 470 from SAN-LAS on 3/16/14. Spirit Airlines is the worst in this industry from paying for a seat to paying for a carry on bag my first experience was my worst experience.

Aldo Rais,1,CGK-HKG return on their new A330. Nice IFE at all seats and easy to use. Nice attitude of FA's who made us feel comfortable on board. The catering was delicious but portion a bit small. Will fly GA on my next trip to SYD.,7/9/2012,5,5,4,5,5,9
A Sargeant,1,Melbourne-Bangkok-Melbourne. Royal Brunei continue to provide an excellent value for money going to Bangkok. It is a dry airline and no alcohol is served. The Cabin Crew are friendly and look to provide a good service. I have yet to meet an unhelpful flight attendant! The flight from Australia left on time and I easily made the short connection time for the flight to Bangkok. Food on all sectors is good and presented well. The Dreamliner (B787) is an excellent aircraft - it is spacious and the beds are lie flat and quite comfortable. The A320 from Brunei to Bangkok is the traditional seat up Business Class but reasonably comfortable for a short haul journey. The return journey was ultimately cancelled because of technical problems the first suggestion of delay came when the first boarding call was about to be made. There were a couple of further delays and notice given of them. It was five o'clock when the flight was to be cancelled. Business Class passengers were accommodated in a five star hotel with dinner and breakfast provided. No lunch had been provided but we did have access to the Business Lounge. Cancellation of my flight meant that I missed a connecting flight on a separate ticket to Canberra and Royal Brunei arranged for me to catch the same flight (at no extra cost) on the next day. An option was given to fly economy class on a different carrier and arriving on the same day as planned but I declines this. For the Business Class passengers I was satisfied with the treatment and the hotel that was utilized we were kept reasonably well informed as to what was happening and what the options were. I will continue to use Royal Brunei to/from Bangkok.,4/4/2015,5,5,4,4,5,9
A Luna,0,"First time flying Frontier instead of Southwest and was very disappointed! Not only do they charge you for checking a bag but also for any carry-on and they charge you to sit with your party. The check in process is inefficient and slow the staff are not nice. Once on the flight there is a charge for any beverages and snacks but water is free! They then try and convince you to sign up for their credit card wit their on-board ""deal"" and awkwardly try and explain why it is a good idea.

Aircraft circled for approx 1 hour over Birmingham tried to land and aborted then diverted to Luton. Again bussed back to Birmingham 4 hrs late. Why do they use this type of aircraft this time of year which is close or outside it operating limits. Surely pilots have accurate weather predictions.,1/31/2013,0,4,0,0,3,NaN

Andrew Fleming,1,LGW-ARN return at the time of the pre Christmas disruption. Had booked non flexi tickets some time before for a reasonable price against SAS and full service alternatives - many offering poor connections. I am not used to budget airlines and as we were a family of 4 (2 small boys) I thought they worked out quite costly so I just paid to check a single case. Check in easy and quick. Outbound was delayed a little over an hour - no information volunteered within the airport I had to ask. Equipment was a 737-300 clean and quite nicely designed cabin. Food on board as others commented was expensive bordering on the extortionate and service seemed to take forever - mostly due to the time taken to process payments. I was overcharged for my order but this was rectified when I realised. Return flight was the first successful departure on the route in 3 days the airline had posted basic information on their web site but enough to convince us to make the 320kmtrip to the airport. Severe delays made us very late but check in staff understanding and helpful. In the event though we were only informed of a delay of about 2 hours after the check in had closed - this was attributed to problems at the London end so quite credible (again though information flow pre-boarding was poor). Overall - reasonable service for the money.,12/27/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,6
Aldo Samulo,0,Tanjung Pandan to Jakarta in early July. Stewardess service is quite good food is just snacks but are tolerable. Flight was delayed almost an hour. During the flight stewardesses were busy selling rather than serving passengers.,11/20/2012,3,2,2,1,3,5
A Sargeant,1,Melbourne - Canberra. Excellent service on an E190. Check in staff were particularly helpful and friendly and allowed me a free of charge last minute change when I told them that I had come from Europe at 04.30. (I had a non refundable non changeable ticket) I had left glasses on the previous flight and they were prepared to change back if that was what I needed to recover the glasses free of charge. The flight left on time and landed about 10 minutes early. I had seat 3A so had plenty of legroom. They managed to serve a basic snack and for such a short flight there was no inflight entertainment (this was as expected). The seat was comfortable and passengers were disembarked quickly. Despite being one of the first off the plane my luggage was waiting for me on the carousal. All in all an excellent experience from check in to luggage collection.,9/17/2013,5,4,3,1,5,9

The first flight was on an Airbus 330 and the second on an Airbus 340. The cabin attendants were friendly and helpful. A small wet towel to freshen up after wake up would have been nice before we ate breakfast. Both flights were punctual. Food was as good as can be expected on a flight. The new Hamad Airport in Doha can only be described as superb in every way. My next journey will be on 3rd February LHR-DOH-KTM and two further round trips expected this year. I will continue to use Qatar Airways.,1/28/2015,5,4,4,5,5,10
Alejandro Arribas,0,"The worst customer service I have ever received. My flight is delayed 5 hours which causes me to miss both of my connections, and when I asked what my new options were at Phuket Airport they refused to provide me with any information, and just shoved the Beijing boarding pass in my hand. When I tried to explain I didn't have to take that specific route, just somehow I needed to get back home to Orlando. In Beijing, I explained my flight was delayed, they completely ignored me, spoke among each other, and handed me a ticket with a middle seat when I specifically requested an isle seat. I asked where my flight was from JFK, several times, and they just yelled ""booked! Booked! Check JFK""! I get to jfk, didn't know what airline I was flying home from or at what time, and I found they intentionally gave me the worst seat on that flight (fortunately Delta is courteous enough to let you choose your seat, so I was able to fix this). Air China was the worst flight experience of my life.",7/24/2015,3,2,2,1,3,1

A Macarron,0,LIM-PTY on a tired 737-700. Flight was expensive. I managed to get the emergency exit which made the flight quite comfortable. Happy to get a warm meal not used to that for a similar flight in Europe anymore. Cabin crew just did their job no smiles. I was shocked at the lack of safety checks both at takeoff and landing. The gentleman next to me had a large bag blocking the emergency exit. None of the crew members noticed despite one FA reminding us to read the evacuation instructions they just didn't even look. The same for seatbelts before landing. They did walk down the aisle but didn't bother to look. I've never seen this before. Finally by the end of the flight I went to the rear toilet and took my rubbish to the galley. When I handed it to the FA he gave me a nasty look I should have left it on my tray and have him come pick it up. Disappointed.,6/5/2013,3,4,4,2,3,5
A Scafani,1,New York-Tokyo B777. Plenty of leg room good food clean facilities courteous FA's good movies and games. I switched from JAL because of the little ANA extras like an I-pod jack at every seat (even economy). Sufficient legroom but only one flight per day.,7/31/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
Aleksandar Elliott,1,DUB to ARN return. Way there was on time plane was clean and in a good state. Crew however were not very friendly no full drink service available and no free food so don't think it's value for money (paid full service fare) same service on way back. On return plane was on time at ARN airport and landed 15 mins early.,2/18/2013,2,4,2,0,4,7
Andrew Hickling,1,"LHR-FCO and return outbound A321 new Club Europe seating, return Boeing 767. I've not flown Club Europe for some years and wasn't looking forward to the flight due to the new seat pitch which is the same as economy. I was fortunate on both journeys to secure a seat in row 1 where you do have extra legroom. The only other seat with extra leg room is the emergency exit row. The food and drink selection was good and the service from the crew was excellent on the return leg.",6/27/2015,4,4,5,NaN,5,8
A Scheel,1,FRA-EZE-FRA with connections in GRU and GIG. Check-in FRA very fast and friendly. FRA-GRU was only lightly booked so I got quite a bit of sleep. IFE very good food average service was okay but nothing special. GRU-EZE nothing to report. EZE check-in was fast and efficient. A light snack was served more filling than tasty. Transfer in GIG quite chaotic the airport was very bare and deserted at 10 pm. GIG-FRA fully booked food below average and service almost robotic. During the flight sleeping was impossible due to very limited space. Crew did not make water/juice rounds. 2 pieces of baggage allowed - rare nowadays.,4/7/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,4
Alessandro Cantoni,1,"Flying MXP-NRT and back in Oct-Nov 2014. Window single seat is excellent and full lie-flat. Entertainment system is OK but could be better. The food is better than business class average but I'm expecting a better wine selection when flying an Italian airline. During the flight flight attendants almost disappear just leaving some cheap self-service drinks and snacks (to be improved). Well the overall impression is that the crew doesn't look so motivated and willing to assist and please passengers. The atmosphere is a little ""sad"" compared to other business classes of competitors.",10/22/2014,4,5,4,4,3,8
A Mace,0,Flew 19 June 2013 Manchester - Calgary return flight 30 June 2013 Calgary - Manchester. Experienced tired old systems and lacking a good meal outbound. Basically handed the left over of a vegetarian meal. Both aircraft's were dated mediocre entertainment repeated on the return journey. Please note that the prices are very cheap for these flights so one has to weigh up the pros and cons. A great deal of consideration will have to be made regarding any future travel. I will admit that the money saved gave us extra for our holiday arrangements. You get what you pay for in this instance.,8/19/2013,3,3,1,1,0,5
Andrew Inman,1,In July 2014 I flew Norwegian from Bangkok to Oslo Oslo to Bergen and Bergen to Paris (Orly) with my wife and young daughter. The price (and the chance to fly a 787 Dreamliner) was what attracted us but we were very happy with the whole experience. All flights were pretty much on time (give or take 10 mins). The Dreamliner was great. The seat space was equivalent to the Qantas A330 we flew Sydney to Bangkok. The pre-ordered (Thai) meal was good and the inflight snack purchase system was fun (swipe your credit card in the entertainment system and order from there). The inflight entertainment was also great both the selection and the system. The Norway / Paris flights were straightforward but good. Leg room was reasonable (I'm 6' 4) especially compared to other LCCs. And the in flight magazine was well worth reading. Hopefully the teething problems that people reported with the Bangkok - Oslo flights have been worked through because I really buy into the ethos of Norwegian. Flying Norwegian saved us well over A$2000 and financially it turned our vacation from an eye-wateringly expensive burden to something that was doable and enjoyable.,9/1/2014,5,4,4,5,4,9
A Schoenagel,1,Washington to Copenhagen. After reading some negative reviews we were pleasantly surprised. Flight and connection was on time. Plane was clean. Seats in economy not too roomy or comfy but about the same as other airlines we have used. Seat bottom pitches forward a bit. Food was pretty good nice and hot for airline food. Headphone/earbuds hurt a lot so bring your own. Good movie selection but the screens were somewhat scratchy and diff to view. On board entertainment system had a few glitches overall. Staff were adequate and professional but not warm/friendly. Good value and experience overall.,7/14/2013,4,3,4,3,3,8
Alessandro Muffolini,1,BRU-EWR / JFK-BRU. A330 pretty clean and well kept (apart from toilets). Ground services were fine both in BRU and NYC food was nice and entertainment ok for a 7 hrs flight. Cabin crew without personality and superficial. They weren't rude but they were not friendly. Whenever I called them they took ages to show up and were always forgetting what I asked 30 seconds before. Cabin crew definitely below average but the rest is ok.,2/16/2012,4,4,4,3,1,6
A Mackenzie,1,CPH-LHR 26th June. Club Europe. BA standards are slipping. The Galleries Lounges are a shadow of their former selves. In the latest round of savings a famous business broadsheet newspaper has been axed the food offerings curtailed and sub-standard and a lack of attention to clearing tables. However the on-board service continues to be of a high standard and the Airbus 321 clean and tidy with very helpful cabin crew. Flight was marred by a lack of bags loaded on the plane due to an IT breakdown at T5 which caused a long queue at CPH baggage dept. for reporting missing bags.,6/30/2014,4,5,4,1,5,5
A Scot,1,Recently flew out of PIE. Surprisingly we left on time even arrived early. Even though they said we had a tailwind behind us I think it was more like less planes traveling that day because of a snowstorm. I had the time for this flight and was actually prepared for their tardiness and was pleased to be on time for once! Would recommend because of price but be prepared to be late.,2/17/2014,5,3,0,0,4,8
Alessio Gori,1,Athens-Sofia-Athens. Athens-Sofia an A319 clean and smart cabin. A quite substantial snack was served by all-female cabin crew who were pleasant and efficient.

A Macleod,1,EDI-IAD via LHR. First time with Virgin Atlantic flew 30th January. Flew little red to LHR pleasant flight staff pleasant then Airbus 330 LHR-IAD. Staff great although flight wasn't busy only gripe is that arm rests are fixed although had 3 premium economy seats to myself. IFE great tiger beer decent wine food ok. Return journey much the same but on VA's new 787 Dreamliner. Impressed loved premium economy felt very spacious on the new plane service again good leg room excellent. United you could learn from Virgins service and meaning of premium economy. Only downside is little red connecting flights stop from Edinburgh later this year so will be difficult to keep using Virgin Atlantic without guaranteed connecting flights with baggage right through. Overall very pleasant experience pity they don't fly Glasgow to New York direct.,2/18/2015,4,5,4,5,5,9
A Scott,1,"Flew Toronto-Puerto Vallarta-Toronto. Early both down and return! Great staff skewed younger and nice change from the stuffy regulars usually on AC! Service was great - purchased a wrap that was tasty! Entertainment - downloaded AC app and no problems both on my iPad and iPhone. Pitfall was not AC but the other passengers - one carry on means one not one plus a purse plus a backpack plus just ""two little bags of shopping"". Yes perhaps that is why you had no leg room your 5 carry on bags! There always has to be ""that one"" passenger and they always seem to sit near me! The seats are tight get over it you are on vacation - want a first class wide seat pay for one on a more expensive airline!

Alex Chaligne,0,Round-trip from Toronto to New Delhi via Brussels in May 2014. The plane was on time but the flight attendants were rude. They never smiled or wanted to exchange pleasantries. The seats were cramped and tight. I was traveling with my husband and our journey to New Delhi was completed without much hassle. On our way back to Toronto we were seated in two different seats and was told at the counter that the flights were full and they wouldn't change our seats. On boarding the same rude flight attendants greeted us. The only time we saw them smiling was when we were leaving the plane. On boarding we noticed that it was not only us who were seated separately almost all the couples had the same issue fortunately we were able to exchange seats. This was the same problem on the flight from Brussels to Toronto. The food we received was of substandard quality when compared to other airlines. The fruit tray they served for breakfast had mould on the fruit. The inflight entertainment system had very few movies we listened to our iPod instead. Ground staff at New Delhi Airport were rude and not helpful. They need considerable improvements in organizing their seats and other basic things like training flight attendants to international standards.,6/8/2014,2,2,1,1,1,3
A Magowan,0,Heathrow-Belfast on an Embraer ERJ-135. The flight was smooth and relaxing. The single cabin attendant was friendly and polite.

A Scott,1,I am a regular business cabin flier usually clocking up between 4 and 5 long haul flights a month. I flew Philippine airlines Jakarta to Manila and Manila to London on July 5 2014. The latter leg is a 14.5 hour flight. Having read some of the reviews on this site I was an exceptionally reluctant flier and in fact protested belatedly at the choice of airline. I will be apologising to my agent for my complaints. The service on the flight was exceptional staff were professional courteous and always helpful in spite of some difficult requests (I chose to anticipate change in time zones by sleeping and eating at all the wrong times). The food was great wine was good cabin and toilets spotless. Although the seats don't recline all the way it is flat bed at a slight angle and perfectly acceptable for sleeping. They have a relatively sparse choice of inflight movies and shows only somewhat compensated for with loan iPads for the flight with additional choices so if are a big consumer of inflight entertainment it may be worth bringing your own especially given the length of the flight. Both flights were on time transfer at Manila faultless if surprisingly personal (escort for most of it) - this in spite of only a 1hour 10 minute layover. Check-in at Jakarta is through a dedicated business class channel which includes immigration. In all a great experience. I realise two flights don't make a big sample but I am happy to recommend until I experience differently.,7/6/2014,5,4,5,3,5,9
A Mah,0,Decided to give them a go for one of my regular MEL-SYD trips - very disappointed. Paid too much for the fare for poor service. Will stick with Qantas.,12/1/2014,1,1,1,3,1,1
Alex de Miranda,0,"Scoot seems cheaper, but with all the inconveniences and add ons, it is actually close to the price of a full service airline. If you pay for a meal, it is atrocious even by airline standards. Basic things like check in from the city of origin to destination if you need a transfer in SIN are not included - there is a fee (marketed as Scoot-Thru) if you do not want to go through customs. I took two trips with them (one â€œBusinessâ€ â€“ read premium economy) and one economy, and have had surprises on both. The latest was not being able to check in online from Hong Kong. Atrociously inconvenient and indicative of shoddy service. Definitely an airline to be avoided.",7/10/2015,1,2,1,1,1,1
A Maier,1,I had a generally positive experience from FLR to LHR. The flight itself was comfortable the seat pitch not as bad as I feared as they put the magazine holder at the top above your knee level. The staff were friendly flight smooth airplane clean. Low-frills service with everything at cost even drinks. My only real complaint is if you book your flight via codeshare there is very little if anything you can to your booking on Vueling website. My flight was booked via BA with Iberia flight number operated by Vueling which prevented me from doing anything like seat requests. Also without an EU passport I could not do online check-in either which I had not experienced before.,2/22/2014,4,3,2,0,4,7
Alex Faure,0,Bangkok to Paris had technical problem in Bangkok and maintenance could not fix it and we had to spend a night at Bangkok. From the moment we left the plane to the following morning at the airport Oman Air staff was invisible and we only had information from the Bangkok airport crisis number (witch is very efficient). The following morning Oman Air told us we would take off at 1130am and spend a 23hr transit at Muscat before taking our second plane to France. The technical problem had not been fixed and we had to change for another plane. We arrived Muscat at 630pm instead of 230pm. Baggage didn't follow. As in Bangkok we didn't meet any Oman Air staff in the hotel and had great difficulty to collect information. Our plane to Paris took of on time but we arrived at destination with a 36 hours delay. Due to those awful conditions I think Oman Air's staff was not very helpful. A french speaking mediator in Muscat and a better coordination between the company and hotels where we spent the 2 nights would have been helpful (60 people were concerned).,12/22/2010,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,1
A Septi,1,I have flown El Al many times both TLV-JFK and TLV-Europe. In terms of legroom while flights between Israel and the US may be a bit tight I have found on all of my flights to Europe that there is plenty of legroom.

A Makiol,1,"I was looking forward to trying CI on my next trip but ended up feeling a bit disappointed with the overall experience. All flights were full which meant no space to spread out. Greeted harshly when boarding, directed to seat. Aircraft was modern and clean. Seats quite close together. My knees were touching the seat in front of me, and I'm not tall. Crew rarely smiled, and didn't appear friendly or approachable. Food of decent quality for economy, drinks limited. Water was warm and served from strange plastic jugs, which makes me think we were drinking tank water. Service was rushed. Entertainment was of very good selection and easy to use. No drink or snack runs until breakfast served.  No amenities however bathrooms kept clean. Crew friendlier on return flight but nothing above average. If the price is significantly cheaper it may be worth flying CI, otherwise I'd spend a bit more and fly with a different airline.",7/24/2015,4,2,3,4,3,5
A Shaban,0,KHI-DOH-JFK-DOH-KHI August 2013. Staff service still remains excellent. On JFK-DOH sector the cabin crew were the most efficient and helpful crew I have encountered in 20 years. On my last leg of journey the entertainment system was not working. Seat has limited recline. QR needs to improve or may lose the Business class segment of it's loyal customers. Premier lounge at Doha is still excellent but Premier lounge duty free shop has very limited selection of products.,9/2/2013,3,4,4,3,5,6
Alex Gibson,1,"My wife and I travel to Bali regularly and this time we were coming home after a cruise. Due to traffic in London we arrived 15 mins before the flight to Jakarta took off, the gates were closed for this flight, but by sheer luck the Garuda Supervisor was still at the desk. We could not thank him enough for his assistance in getting us on our flight back to Australia. We have great faith in this airline and would recommend it to anyone who was thinking of flying Garuda. Excellent airline and the service cannot be faulted.",7/23/2015,5,5,5,5,5,10
A Makiol,1,Flew BNE-SIN return in Economy class. All flights departed and arrived on time. Aircraft was modern and clean A330 with nice interior. Seats were not the most comfortable and felt a bit cramped. IFE was very good user friendly. The cabin crew are wonderful very helpful kind and courteous. Food was of high quality however the continental breakfast was a let down. All kinds of amenities were available and snacks provided on request. I did enjoy my trip with Singapore Airlines maybe a tad overrated. I feel other Asian airlines such as KE CX CI are just as good but still one of the best airlines you can fly!,7/6/2014,5,3,4,5,5,8
Andrew Jenkins,1,"I few BA from Manchester to London, BA from London to Hong Kong, Cathay Pacific from Hong Kong to Auckland, Cathay Pacific from Auckland to Hong Kong, Cathay Pacific from Hong Kong to London and BA from London to Manchester. I will review these flights separately. BA from Manchester to London: Good, short flight. On time. Comfortable. Good service. BA from London to Hong Kong: Excellent. Upstairs in an A380. Quiet. Comfortable. Good food. Attentive service. On -time. Couldn't have been better. Cathay Pacific from Hong Kong to Auckland: Delayed (about an hour). Uncomfortable (bucket type seats). Noisy aircraft (A340). Poor food. Staff were not particularly friendly. Cathay Pacific from Auckland to Hong Kong: Delayed by 3 hours. Uncomfortable (bucket type seats). Noisy aircraft (A340). As I missed my BA flight because of the delayed Cathay Pacific flight, I was put up in a lovely airport hotel (Regal) by Cathay Pacific. Well-organised. 5 minutes walk from the airport. Breakfast voucher included. Cathay Pacific from Hong Kong to London: Slightly delayed, but not the fault of CP. Comfortable, quiet aircraft (777). Good service. BA from London to Manchester: Good, short flight. On time. Comfortable. Good service. All in all, I much prefer BA to CP but CP did look after me well because of a delay to a CP flight, so full marks there.",6/16/2015,3,3,2,2,3,7
Alex Guo,1,Flew Shanghai Pudong (PVG) - Beijing (PEK) domestic first class on an A321. Lounge in PVG was a disappointment - I'd say below average standards across China based on my experiences. Flight itself was good. Seat was a recliner. Typical on narrow-body legroom was good but didn't recline much. Food was pretty tasty asked for beer and water and was provided. Crew came around often and were friendly. There was personal IFE but the controls were a bit difficult to figure out and the touch-screen was slow to respond. Overall a pleasant experience though minor things can be improved. Considering the price I paid (even a little less than full-fare economy when I booked a week in advance) I would definitely recommend.,7/6/2014,5,3,5,2,5,8

A Shankar,1,We travelled Air India business class in December 2014 and recently from London to Mumbai and Delhi to London. We found the plane modern and clean and the crew were delightful. The reviews we read did not resemble our experience and as regular business class passengers on other airlines we were very happy with the experience. The only critique was that the food was a bit limited and not as proficient as other airlines. The seats were spacious and the flat beds very comfortable and we will definitely be using this airline again.,3/28/2015,5,5,3,4,5,8
Andrew Kaufman,1,Vienna to Dulles in Business class. Superb in every respect. Others have been critical of the seating. I found the seats to be the best in the air. Yes they were firm but in a comfortable and supportive way. My next flight was on United business class and the softer seats were not nearly as comfortable as on Austrian. Food and service were outstanding. The hi-tech seat controls and audiovisual options were similarly good. In many rows the seating was 1-2-1 so plenty of options for privacy when traveling alone. Cathay Pacific was my previous all time favorite but Austrian is even better.,11/6/2014,4,5,5,5,5,10
Alex Hempel,0,Rome - Paris in October. Despite having checked in online (after having virtually been harassed to do so) we encountered a massive queue at the bag drop in Rome. Way too many passengers and way too few open desks. With our flight nearing the cut off we wouldn't have made it if they hadn't called us over to another counter - a blink- and-you'll-miss-it announcement. With boarding starting in ten minutes desk staff was not even able to tell us our boarding gate. Having made it there boarding was slow and confusing with no announcements made of any kind. We were bussed to the plane but could only board through the front door which slowed things down even more. Flight was uneventful staff was polite but not especially friendly. All in all the only positive aspect of this flight was the fare. Everything else just showed that this airline is operating on the cheap and isn't even trying to hide it.,10/22/2013,3,3,0,NaN,2,4
A Man,0,Recently flew DUB-ORD - 22 year old 767 ORD-LAX-SFO 737's SFO-LAX-LHR 737 and new 777. Apart from the fact that I got there and back safely I must say what a disappointment the airline is in terms of inflight entertainment comfort staff and food/drinks. I fly regularly from the UK mainly East on EU/Asian airlines or within Europe and I now realise how spoilt we are here. When comparing AA to QR EK etc they just do not compare in any regard. The old 767 aircraft in a very tired state still had analogue buttons for their armrest music entertainment system and huge drop down crt displays. Food was awful and very poor quality on takeoff. The pre-landing snack a deep dish pizza was much better albeit on the greasy side. Domestic US services were on 737's - one with the new sky interior and 2 older interiors. All perfectly fine to get me from point A to B. Plenty of rather expensive food purchase options in the terminals and ability to bring food on board was good. I did not think much of the in- flight food menu for purchase - limited choice and not great quality it would seem. Nice touch for in-flight wi-fi although I didn't use it. The biggest disappointment and a real embarrassment was the supposed 'flagship American service' from LAX-LHR. Super cramped seating in 10 abreast layout in economy meant no elbow room whatsoever. Very poor in-flight entertainment system - hard to navigate difficult to find music titles plus generally limited selection. The catering was shockingly poor for dinner a chicken dish which was flavourless and served with a salad with grated cheese and dressing some crackers with cheese spread a biscuit for dessert and a cold and chewy roll. Breakfast was similarly disappointing and consisted of a yoghurt orange juice and a horrible leathery croissant served with jam and butter. A continental breakfast on a service between the states and the UK? Where is the sausage and eggs? Even Qatar give the above and a hot dish as their breakfast in better quality. The embarrassment really comes with the announcement at the start of the flight where we are introduced and welcomed to their 'flagship' service. It is laughable. On a plus note the drinks service was perfect. Crew were very hit and miss on all sectors. 767 is way above the 777 in terms of comfort and space. I would much rather have 9 abreast in a 777 or a 22 year old 767 then this flagship 777. Good USB/power options though - that's probably the only thing that they got right on AA136. I would go out of my way to avoid AA in future unless price is the only factor.,10/5/2014,2,1,1,1,1,1
A Shatten,1,"We flew on 4 long-haul legs in June and July business class. Service was friendly and efficient throughout. The meals were well-considered: light dishes were available for every meal plenty to eat and drink. The seats however were not to our satisfaction. There's heaps of room but the back of the seat is straight and the headrest pushes your head forward. The recline angle is small and the adjustable footrest is useless. There is a footstool but I am 173cm tall (5' 8"") and it was too far away for me to use comfortably. So I spent much of the time trying to find a comfortable sitting position. The seat converts to a flat bed and in this position it is fine for sleeping. SIA uses other airlines' lounges in many airports. I hope they don't use United again because their lounge in Melbourne hasn't been updated since discos were fashionable. (SIA's lounge in MEL was being renovated).",7/28/2013,4,2,4,5,4,7

A Sheppard,0,Manchester to Orlando and back. Economy seats are the most uncomfortable I have encountered. Food was also the worst that my husband and I have ever had on an airline. The portions were small and you got the feeling that this was the cheapest meal that Virgin could order. The 'breakfast' coming back was 'muffin tops' granola bar and a small bit of juice. So basically sugar sugar and more sugar. I don't expect bacon and eggs in economy but even a good quality croissant with some butter would have been better. Served no tea and coffee as they said there was a 'problem' out of Manchester. This flight left Orlando so not sure why they couldn't order supplies out of Orlando. The only thing good I can say was that I thought the inflight entertainment was good and that the crew were attentive. It's not their fault that they were serving the cheapest of cheap catering. I thought on both legs that they regularly came around with water/juice during the flight. I would only fly Virgin again if there were no other choice.,7/10/2013,1,1,1,4,4,2

Toothbrushes put out during the night and restrooms were kept clean by FA's. Delayed on the return due to technical issues however the purser and FA's handled the situation well.

A Mann,0,After 4 flights between BFN and JNB I must confess that there is no standard in the service. One flight was excellent - orange juice before the snack which was served with water and a drink. The snacks are tiny. The last flight from BFN we were told that due to the short flight time only water and juice would be served. It was the same flying time as the other flights and two cabin crew onboard. Why no consistency?,11/13/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,5

CSA flight from AMS to Prague was OK new plane comfortable seats although no food provided - only drinks and a tiny pack of crackers - a bad surprise if you've missed your breakfast. The crew were not smiling or willing to communicate reasons for a delay. Transfer in Prague airport was nightmarish: CSA apparently does not have any interactions with B2 and although the flight is codeshared B2 is handled by a different company and CSA refuses to help with making transfer happen even for a SkyPriority passenger - very disappointing.,9/4/2012,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,5

Andrew Mackrill,1,"The inaugural Swiss flight from Zurich to Malta on July 1st. Business class was about half full over five rows. Given the occasion there was nothing special at the gate on departure Zurich. But we got the full fire brigade water jet arrival in Malta despite being a little late, together with a nice welcome ceremony by Malta airport in the terminal with flowers and cake for every passenger and the crew. Business class service enroute was very professional and pleasant too, with a substantial hot lunch with meat loaf as a main course as a surprise option on this 1155 departure. A cold dish was also offered. The meal came with salad, dessert and cheeses too. The only let down was a mediocre and inexpensive supermarket brand as the only white wine on offer. The wines on offer in the Swiss business lounge in Zurich was far superior.",7/10/2015,3,3,4,1,4,8
A Shul,0,Flew TLV-BKK with a 747. Plane was old and dirty. The service was okay but the food was inedible. The TV's were on a loop with 2 out of the 4 channels not working. Unfortunately this is the only airlines for me to travel to Israel but whenever I get the chance I'm taking another airline.,10/22/2014,1,1,1,0,5,2
Alex Michaels,0,BUE-PTY. Arrived at Buenos Aires 5.30am for 7.30am flight and the line was unbelievable. Told by customer services that the flight was delayed so not to worry about a 1 hour wait. When I started to ask her about our connection being effected in Bogota she walked off saying she can't help. We went back 30 mins later and there was no one helping out and only 2/3 desks open operating very inefficiently. The flight did leave late and it took about an hour to dump our bags without any information but once onboard it was good new seats AVOD etc and the change over in Bogota was fine. FA's hopeless. I think it's worth paying extra for reliability.,11/30/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,5
A Marassi,0,DEL-MXP Tuesday April 24th. Delay at Delhi: more than 90 minutes without any information or communication from the cockpit. The information main panel inside the cabin informing about the elapsed time the outside temperature etc. was out of order from the take off until the landing in MXP. The cabin crew assistance has been awful: soon after the meal service all the cabin crew without any exception disappeared.,9/3/2012,4,4,3,1,1,2
Andrew Maile,1,CGK - Abu Dhabi. Quick check in but we departed 90 minutes late. I was concerned that I would miss my connecting flight in Abu Dhabi (codeshare on Etihad) The stewardess told me it would all be fine and not to worry . Onboard service was satisfactory; reasonable IFE decent food etc. etc. On arrival at Abu Dhabi I rushed to the connecting flight gate but it had already departed. Was rerouted onto Qatar Airways. Overall Qatar was significantly better than Garuda. The difference between a 4 star and a 5 star airline I guess.,10/15/2013,4,3,3,3,4,6

Andrew Malins,1,Flew ZB286 London Gatwick to Tenerife on 2nd February 2015. Flight on time. Excellent unobtrusive service from cabin crew. The best thing about Monarch now is the new slimline seating. They are comfortable enough for a 4 hour flight and would be OK for longer flights. The fixed angle of seat back is good (a compromise between fully upright and reclined) so there are no hassles with the passenger in front depriving you of your legroom. I am 6ft 3ins and there were a full 2 inches spare in front of my knees so I could sit comfortably and there is space for your tablet in the seat back in front. This is such an improvement on other budget airlines.,2/12/2015,5,5,4,0,5,10
Alex Sandri,0,Rome-Manila via Riyadh and Jeddah on return flight. Tickets are cheap but the trip is challenging. Starting from the long queue at check-in in Rome. First leg was ok except for entertainment which is far below standard. Vegetarian food was quite good toilets ok with a variety of cologne hand cream etc. Good travel kit. Stopover in Riyadh - airport is a nightmare with no shops. Riyadh-Manila - toilets barely had soap and towels. Return Manila-Jeddah-Rome was a nightmare. Manila-Jeddah delayed 5 hrs. They provided food but nothing for vegetarians so I had to buy food. Arrived in Jeddah where staff were unfriendly.,2/7/2012,2,2,3,1,1,1
A Mark,1,BUD-EIN-BUD. Online check-in worked well both flights were on time the cabin crew was friendly. Legroom is not too spacious but as for a low-cost carrier the airline is absolutely great in my opinion!,7/15/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,10
Andrew McGinty,0,Brisbane to LA and back Sep 13 and can only describe the service as poor. The majority of the crew are young and very unhelpful. The food is appalling especially when you sit at rear of plane and are unable to choose what you like. The drink service is poor and on a 13 hour flight if you want a drink you go looking for them they don't come to you. I asked one stewardess for a beer whilst she was serving tea and coffee and was quite rudely told 'No Later'. Had one beer in 13 hours. Been to the US 3 times 1st and last time on Virgin. Inflight entertainment was good seats bit hard but bearable.,9/24/2013,1,2,1,4,1,NaN

Alex Smith,1,Flew from Paris to Mykonos. Very long lines. Check-in staff gossiping with their colleagues. Plane took 45 minutes to take off after departure time. Seats weren't cleaned from previous flight (crumbs and chewing gum). 3 euros for a glass of water.,8/21/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,5
A Martim,0,Paris ORY to La Romana (Dominican republic) Economy class going and business class for coming back. At the airport for the two flights check-in and boarding were quick and organized and there was no delay (rare for a charter airline). The plane was a new Boeing 747-400. Seats very cramped food disgusting but cabin crew professional and friendly. Coming back I was in business class which is located on the upper-deck : seats were comfortable with a personal screen food good and service nice. I think the business class of Corsair is not a business class like Air France British Airways or Singapore Airlines but better than Air India or Air Mauritius. Price was only 150 euros more for one flight.,5/1/2006,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
Andrew Mortimer,0,Flew Beijing-Pudong and Macau-Pudong-Bejing. First flight on A330 which was not very full. Seats still a bit cramped and no food served just a very processed drink and I am diabetic! Macau through Pudong-Bejing was on A320 both flights. MU did not listen to my pleas not to check bag all the way through to Beijing and promptly lost it in Shanghai. Flight late and check in at Macau disorganised for a very small airport. Baggage services at Beijing very unhelpful. Would only fly MU again if no alternative.,6/29/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,1
Alex Taberner,1,JFK-LAX on a 757-200 Transcon. Flight pushed back 5 mins ahead of schedule and arrived 30 mins early. The aircraft was recently refitted and the new cabin is spectacular. Felt clean modern fresh airy bright and very comfortable. The IFE was superb. Screens were huge choice was endless and picture quality great (not the standard screens you see on most aircraft). Staff were attentive and happy - came around with the drinks/snacks cart twice and I lost count how many times they came around offering water. Tea/coffee and snacks are complimentary sandwiches etc available for purchase. For a long coast to coast flight Delta far exceeded my expectations.,10/5/2014,4,4,4,5,5,9
Andrew Noble,1,I have to report an excellent journey JNB-FRA-LCY. New refurbished Business cabin on the A380 is very comfortable and a lovely decent sized pillow on which to sleep. Lie flat seat/bed is good but could be a bit narrow at shoulder level. However I managed 5-6 hrs sleep which is unusual for me on a lon flight. Food delicious especially on my outbound FRA-JNB sector Roast Goose which was perfect! Crew on all sectors were friendly and professional and the transit through FRA was a breeze. I would advise people to choose seats at rear of the 380 upper deck pref. row 26/27 as LH serve their food from the rear moving forward so you'll always have a full menu choice if seated here. A lovely travelling experience with an airline that maintains its pedigree.,11/20/2014,5,4,5,4,5,9
A Martin,0,LHR-BAH-BKK return. Cramped tatty planes no IFE filthy toilets rude surly and unprofessional check-in staff poor flight attendants and vile food. Itâ€™s not that the flights were cheap either. Never again with Gulf Air.,1/12/2010,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
Alex Wilke,1,YVR-MNL MNL-BKK. Excellent service and seat-back entertainment systems. The food was very good and was served often throughout the flight.

A Martinez,0,I have never seen anything like I saw today at MIA. We arrived an hour and a half before my son's domestic flight and could not believe the chaos at American's ticket counters. There were long lines at every kiosk and even longer lines at the checked bag line. After finally checking in at a kiosk my son could not print his boarding pass because the machine had run out of paper. I had been standing in the checked bag line and when we approached the employee and explained that we had a luggage tag but the boarding pass had not printed she directed us to another line that had easily more than 60 people! I then approached another American Airlines employee and asked for assistance and she was incredibly rude and offered no help. Fortunately we were able to get my son's boarding pass on the phone. Despite a ridiculous security check-in line he was able to board his flight on time. A friend of his that was on the same flight had to forcefully argue with other employees to get on the flight because they said they had closed the gate and would not let him board even though he was checked in!,1/19/2015,1,1,1,1,1,1
Alexander Blair,1,Friday night back to Almaty they did brilliantly. Excellent selection of drinks served by staff who knew how to mix them well prepared fresh food friendly and professional cabin staff newish plane comfortable seats  good music selection (I even have to admit I found the crass candid-camera-esk overhead TV amusing too then off the aeroplane and out of the airport and into a taxi in 5 mins max.,7/13/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
Andrew Powell,1,ZRH to LJU as a continuation to a flight with Swiss. Adria were not as good as Swiss but they did make us feel welcome onboard and look after us. The return flight was much better than the outbound flight with the cabin crew smiling and talking to passengers. The CRJ was clean and looked in better condition than other airlines equipment I have flown in the past.,1/19/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,7
A Sijapati,1,DEL-KTM. I have always used Jet Airways whenever possible to adjust in my flight legs. I find their service to be better than other Indian carriers (or international carriers for that matter). Their selection of IFE is huge and diverse. The aircraft is newer than most European/American carriers and thus have more advanced features like larger screens easy navigation/selection etc. The food selection is also nice and include a combination of both regional and international meal options. Finally the group and air crew service attitude and willingness to help stands out. They are courteous and have a good deal of professionals makes you feel you're in good hands. I would fly Jet whenever possible!,8/14/2014,4,4,4,5,4,9
A Matema,0,Living and working in South Africa I fly home to Zimbabwe fairly often and try to be patriotic and use the national airline. I have only been delayed once in the past year. Food is good and service also of acceptable standards.

Alexander Eduard van Kessel,1,Madrid-Bogota-Neiva. Being a handicapped person I mentioned this with the booking for assistance. The attendants were always on time with a wheelchair. Had a seat against the wall where the toilets are on an Airbus A330 lots of legspace and no need to walk too much. Very nice crew and flight attendants. Overall very pleasant flight and as a regular to Colombia visiting my parents in law I always when possible book Avianca.,4/10/2014,5,4,4,5,5,10
A Silva,1,Sao Paulo-Campinas to Salvador and back. Easy to use web site made booking process fast. Price was 50% less than the fare out of other Sao Paulo airports.

Onboard service simple: drinks and a selection of snacks but the crew were enthusiastic and pleasant.,5/28/2009,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
Andrew Ratcliff,0,"I flew Norwegian DY7005 Stockholm - JFK. The flight was an hour late departing and the gate crew did not update the waiting passengers through an announcement or an update to the status screens so none of the passengers knew what was happening. I spent about $70 in extras (food mostly) and still spent less on the flight but the experience left me feeling ""nickel and dimed"". The aircraft was a 787 Dreamliner and I thought the seats were more comfortable than most. The entertainment system was solid but had a poor selection compared to the United flight I took on my way to Europe with about 3X the selection. The big windows made it possible to see out from the middle section of seats. The staff did not seem to be well trained and the lighting and sound systems changed abruptly.",12/16/2013,3,5,2,2,4,5
Alexander Ford,1,I was quite impressed to see that not all airlines have gone the low cost way. Check-in was smooth and quick. I was given a pre-assigned seat at the window which I don't like. I think they should ask and not assign. The staff wasn't able to give me an explanation. Security at Luxembourg is very rude and unfriendly but not the airlines fault. On board a brand new 737 with sky interior I was impressed how quickly the stewardess changed my seat to an empty aisle. They even served apÃ©ritifs with a snack before a meal with free wine and all. And when I thought this is it they insisted to serve digestifs with the coffee. I'm sure I didn't pay much more than with other big airlines but this small player has something on offer on a 4 hour flight.,8/19/2013,4,3,5,3,5,8
A Maujean,0,Sydney-Reunion-Mauritius. Not impressed staff sometimes quite rude. One meal with drinks provided after take off soggy sandwich about half way and small snack before landing.

Return flight not better!,3/15/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,3
A Simons,0,"Shenzhen to Yantai on a 737 which takes approx 3 hours. Shenzhen airport is not too bad but not great. Shandong Airlines is the only direct flight from SZX to YNT however with one flight per day at inconvenient times for business travellers like myself. Flight delayed 3 hours due to ""bad weather"" and the return journey 2 days later was delayed by 2 hours however with no reason provided although a meal voucher was offered at Yantai airport but food was inedible. Flight attendants are very well dressed well trained professional efficient and friendly. Seat space is typical economy however no PTV's in seats and no overhead entertainment shown either.

Andrew Reid,1,"DXB-MEL, 12.5 hrs, second leg of CAI-MEL on Qantas ticket but first leg operated by Emirates. Qantas web site wouldn't do online check-in since first leg with Emirates so had to do it on Emirates web site, which wouldn't let me alter DXB-MEL seats. Aircraft new and well kept with comfortable seating. Boarding was fine and departure on-time. Although seats quite close together for such a long flight the leg room was good due to IFE being kept out of the way. Meals were pretty good and staff came around offering snacks and drinks regularly. IFE excellent - I found a good range of films and my kids were kept happy for the whole flight as well. They did most things well, but a few little things let them down: - Not enough immigration forms for all passengers. (Honestly, they know the number of pax on a flight, it can't be that hard) - When I asked for an amenities kit about 1.5 hrs before landing, they told me they had run out. - Flight path maps weren't working so it was hard to tell where we were. (Data like eta, altitude, were working) If they could fix these simple things, it would be a great flight experience for a price below Qatar, Emirates and Etihad.",7/4/2015,4,3,4,5,4,6
A Maynard,1,MAN-JMK-MAN. Brand new A320 both ways. Outbound the crew worked as a fantastic team the young female Captain was very informative about the route. The return flight seemed to be much busier some of the flight deck announcements were inaudible. I tried the cheese melt hot sandwich from the bistro. One could only describe it as vile. Hot on one side almost frozen in the middle. Two passengers nearby threw theirs away. Arrived back 30 minutes early. Overall great fantastic service on brand new aircraft I'd just give the Bistro a swerve next time. D E & F seats nearer the front have tighter pitch than seats A B & C.,5/25/2015,4,3,2,NaN,4,8
Alexander Huehmer,1,BUD-ZRH-HKG-ZRH-BUD I had several flights in C with Swiss in recent years and never left with any disappointment. The seats are comfortable and had a decent 5-6 hrs sleep on both long legs in the flat-bed. Service efficient and friendly. Meals are pretty good - especially the breakfast service is pimped you get a wide selection incl. hot dishes. Wine and liquor selection awesome. Entertainment working fine with many choices of films CDs etc. Transfer and connections fine. The last leg had some technical issues and we had to return soon after takeoff back to ZRH as a precaution the pilot announced.,11/13/2013,4,4,4,5,4,9

Andrew Russo,0,"Vienna to Frankfurt (Lufthansa) Frankfurt-Washington D.C. (Condor). Upon arrival to Frankfurt the departure screen showed my Condor flight 2 hours delayed. I arrived at the new departure time and we were called to board except we didn't actually board we were just moved into a small room near the gate. As soon as the last person presented their ticket an announcement was made ""the flight is delayed we have no information."" I asked the gate agent simply if the plane was in Frankfurt or still on the way from another destination. She replied ""we have no idea."" An hour later I called customer service to inquire about other flight options since I had a meeting the following day. Customer service said they could do nothing and that I should write a formal letter of complaint which didn't solve my immediate problem of getting to Washington. At this point the flight was 5.5 hours late. I asked for my bags to be returned and called Lufthansa to arrange a flight the following day. I then waited 2 hours for my bag.

Never felt uncomfortable onboard. Aircraft's clean and spacious on all legs. Entertainment and food on B777-300 excellent.

A Skidmore,1,Manchester - Atlanta - Quito - August 2014. Flew Delta for the first time in about a decade and was very impressed. Transatlantic flew an old but recently refurbished 767-2 which was clean and comfortable. Was fortunate to get an exit row seat meaning I had lots of leg room and being 6'3 this was a blessing! Seats were a little hard but no more so than other airlines. Entertainment system was very good lots of options and food and drinks were served regularly. Cabin crew were very friendly and always happy to help. Flight departed on time and arrived early in ATL. ATL-QUI - very old 757-2 and desperately needed refurbing. Seats were worn out no entertainment overhead TVs existed but not used and cabin crew were less friendly. Drinks only served once on a 5 hour flight and food was very poor in comparison to the other flight. Standard American airline for me very good transatlantic but domestic/South America used tired fleet and much less effort made. Will certainly use again if I need to fly transatlantic as was an excellent experience but still much to improve on the other side of the pond.,9/17/2014,4,3,4,4,4,7

A Smith,0,They delayed my flight by 3 days and were incredibly rude and unapologetic. I was supposed to fly from Sydney to Buenos Aires via Auckland and Santiago. I turned up at the check in counter in Sydney and was told the flight would be delayed because the plane hadn't arrived yet from Auckland but it would only be a couple of hours. When I returned they said the plane would not be arriving after all and that we would not leave Sydney for another two days. Staff were rude and unhelpful and once we were taken to the accommodation we didn't hear from them again except for a piece of paper under the hotel door telling us to be ready at 5am. After two days we went back to airport there was no staff member there and we had to go from counter to counter trying to find out which flight we were on. After finally checking in and going through immigration we were at the boarding gate when we were told that we would not be flying out after all as there was no plane to meet us in Auckland. No staff representative. I ended up changing to LAN Chile who were excellent.,8/20/2012,1,0,1,0,1,1
Andrew Shrugs Hall,0,Alitalia check in at Heathrow were superb but after that the whole experience was the worst we've ever experienced on a long haul flight. Staff in Rome airport were rude during our delayed connecting flight and when we eventually got onto the plane to Buenos Aires we all sat waiting in our seats for over an hour for the flight to commence no refreshments boiling hot and no explanation to what the delay was. Staff were indifferent to the passengers requests that's when they could be bothered to work. Finally the inflight entertainment to help us forget this nightmare was a disaster in as much the screen would randomly switch off during movies. Avoid at all costs until Etihad take over.,7/29/2014,0,3,1,2,1,NaN
Alexander Mokretsov,1,DME-DUS-VRA and back. Excellent airline which offers very competitive prices but also good service. The flights from Moscow and back were on time. The connections in Dusseldorf went smoothly. The transatlantic flights were great. I enjoyed excellent entertainment system which provided wide selection of great movies and music. The food were very tasty and fresh. The staff were very efficient and polite. All in all a very pleasant experience. I would recommend not to economize though and pay some extra fee for the preferred seat selection since the leg room is rather scarce.,10/23/2013,5,4,5,5,4,9

A McCallum,0,Monday 1st July - departing Glasgow at 19.55 arriving Gatwick 21.20. EZY894. I am fed up with the poor standards of customer service from Easyjet. Everything is geared towards themselves rather than the passenger it would appear we are there for their convenience not the other way around. I am fed up of standing around (particularly at Glasgow) when the board is flashing final call and yet we have not moved a millimetre onto the aircraft. Having encouraged us all now to take hand luggage rather than pay the exorbitant prices to put luggage into the hold they are now using gestapo like techniques to force you to put it into the hold as the flights are full. This latest ploy now - no check in staff - is another example of poor customer service. Their flights are no longer cheap and the seat/leg room is nothing short of ridiculous.,7/14/2013,1,1,2,NaN,1,NaN

A Smith,0,Planning an evening flight to Las Vegas our intention was to sleep for the majority of the 5 hr and 45 min flight. That didn't happen. The party plane was in full swing from the moment they closed the door halfway through they reported that they had run out of alcohol. Needless to say the small seats were that much smaller when everyone around you is drunk. Fast forward to our flight home this flight (from Las Vegas to Philly) was cancelled due to weather. After booking another night at our hotel we learned that they had put us on a flight leaving in a few short hours. The final kicker was when we realized there was no flight from Las Vegas to Philly showing at either airport. All in all it was a major hassle and then the flight home was packed tighter than the flight there. Never again will I fly Spirit.,2/25/2014,2,1,1,1,1,1
Alexander Mokretsov,0,DME-BCN-PMI and back which turned to be PMI-BCN-OLY. On the route from Moscow to Palma-de-Mallorca via Barcelona: the planes were new the crew were great the seats comfortable and the timetable convenient. The problems began on my way back. The plane from Palma to Barcelona was delayed for an hour so at the time of landing in Barcelona my connecting flight to Moscow was supposed to depart. Instead of delaying the flight to Moscow for 30 min which would have been sufficient for us to board Vueling opted to send a plane to DME without us. What was even more infuriating is that Vueling representatives assured me that the flight was waiting for us at D10 gate. The transit desk managers could offer nothing better than the next flight at the same time tomorrow! Such situation was unacceptable for me so they gave me a boarding pass to Paris-Orly flight in the early morning. The flight to Orly was not good - the plane was extremely old and dirty. What I can say is that Vueling is not so cheap but has very convenient schedules from Moscow to Barcelona and back. To sum up could be an option if you are flying without baggage and with at least a 3-hour connection. Otherwise stress is guaranteed.,9/24/2012,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,4
A McCullough,1,Flew Toronto to Panama City Direct got a great seat-sale. Did the web check-in for way down got row 11 and when you do the web check-in for the first leg it automatically did the web-check in for our return flight but somehow we got row 30 not sure how that happens? We checked in at Panama City and were able to get row 32 (only row where a seat hadn't been booked). Agent gave us aisle and window and nobody booked middle seat so we got lucky and had all 3 seats to ourselves. Service on way down was outstanding but I think they were short-staffed on way back because service was slow and they ran out of chicken meals (to be expected I guess when you're at the back of the bus). Blankets pillows drinks meals and headphones were all provided without extra cost. Would definitely fly Copa again.,11/22/2012,5,4,5,3,4,7
Andrew Taylor,1,Just returned from Vancouver to London on a direct flight in club class. We were surprised and pleased with the level of service and the constant supply of food and drink the food was very good. The stewardess was very pleasant and professional. The airfares are much lower than other airlines. Those who complain about minor issues your not in a 5 star hotel for a week remember it's a cheap flight you've booked for a few hours travel. Pay a much higher price with a premium airline next time and then make a comparison. We will book again with Air Transat for our next trip to Canada.,5/27/2015,5,3,5,5,5,10
Alexander Schober,0,I have flown MIA-JFK on an old B767-300. Flight was full. Seat very old but comfortable and pitch was ok. Entertainment only through overhead screens. I was shocked that this aircraft had the new hatrack design only for premium cabins Economy cabin still had the 90's hatrack design which a) looks very old and b) does not have enough room for everyone. Only non-alcoholic drink service for this 2hr flight. Staff very unprofessional. There seems to be an inconsistency in their uniform. One female flight attendant was wearing - what seemed to be her personal apron that featured dozens of US flags next to each other. After landing in JFK we had to hold at a remote stand before our gate was available. As usual passengesr were standing up and retrieving their bags from the overhead bins despite the captain making an announcement to remain seated. No flight attendant took any action only a Captain in American Airlines uniform travelling as a passenger made assertive requests for everyone to remain seated to which everyone then complied. Also saw a male flight attendant making a call on his mobile phone during taxiing to the gate. Very unprofessional!,1/25/2014,3,4,1,1,1,5
Andrew Tran,0,SIN-SGN. Price was excellent. Check-in and boarding was easy. Flew on an A320. Flight attendants seemed in a bad mood. Seat was uncomfortable little legroom no IFE and not enough recline. Food was extremely cheap but it wasn't really filling - it was good though. Bad presentation of food looked like it was a frozen dinner.,10/29/2012,5,3,4,1,2,5
A McIntosh,1,16th Feb 2014 LHR-Nairobi. Flight on time. Very clean aircraft. Not full so able to spread out. Comfy chairs good IFE and movie choice. Food was delicious requested Vegan meal and it was delivered. Cabin crew were lovely and attentive. Drinks were given by the double! Honestly couldn't fault them brilliant flight.,3/10/2014,4,4,5,4,4,10
A Smyth,1,Business class (MEX-SCL-IPS return). I found the service to be consistent crew friendly aircraft clean and in good condition (767) and food tasty. The inflight entertainment worked and a good selection. The on board service did seem to take a bit of time to get going and the seat did seem a bit narrow around the shoulders when reclined into the flat bed. Other than that the flights were great. Check-in at all airports was easy lounges comfortable no lounge in Easter Island but I didn't expect that anyway as its such a unique airport and flights were on time. Frequent flyer miles were added to my BA account within the week and I had no baggage issues.,5/4/2013,5,4,4,4,5,10
Andrew Wade,1,London to Cochin Kerala with my wife and son. I booked them because they were at least 25% cheaper than big name rivals. All 4 flights went smoothly with hardly any delays. Planes are older than some airlines but an upside of that is they seem to have more legroom! Entertainment system is also a non event but I knew that when booking. The only other minus for some may be the no alcohol policy but at least you arrive fresh at your destination! KWI airport is small but clean with decent facilities and easy to navigate. All outlets take credit cards even for a small purchases such as single fries or coffee so no currency hassles. The planes were clean the crews helpful and the meals fine and we saved a lot of money by flying with them. I would recommend over other alternatives if you are making a saving on the fare and I would use them again.,4/11/2013,5,4,4,2,4,7
Alexander Stevens,1,I was flew premium economy from Gatwick to St. Lucia but on the way back we got upgraded to upper class. It was very nice and new with new lighting colours and various patterns across the cabin. The seats were very new and modern and the bed was comfy. My suggestion is that these seats are only on the A330-300 but to give everyone this modern even more luxury experience I think it should be released across the whole fleet (not A320). The seats and the bar. This would give the airline an outlook on the modern perspective of Virgin Atlantic's Upper Class and luxury flying.,11/20/2014,4,5,5,4,5,10
A Snelling,1,Bangkok - Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai - Bangkok - Nothing negative to say about Nok. Check in was easy flights were on time and the in-air service was good. I had booked these flights from the US months ahead of time but everything was in the system and we had no problems whatsoever. I anticipated issues with luggage due to past problems with discount carriers but this was unjustified with Nok. Considering the low cost of the flights there is no reason not to fly Nok. The service greatly exceeds that of full-fare US airlines these days.,11/21/2012,5,5,5,5,5,10
A McLeod,1,Flew on Rouge from Toronto to Montego Bay and back. Great flight attendants and staff. I am a 6ft average male and the seats are slightly more cramped than I'm used to on Air Canada but on my last vacation on Westjets and previously Sunwing are no better or seats were about the same. Flight was on time both ways and I enjoyed the wifi streaming of movies and music on my iPad. Food for sale on board was fresh and lots of choice. Overall I felt very safe and that's the most important thing.,6/9/2014,4,3,4,4,4,7
Alexander Williamson,0,Flight out from Glasgow was supposed to depart at 16.35 on 4th July 2013 but were told bluntly during check in that there should be further updates at 7pm. No staff available for updates and garbled announcements from Glasgow airports world class PA system. Eventually we managed to get an explanation of sorts from a TC manager at around 9.30pm (5 hour delay). Everyone was just glad we were finally on our way to Antalya but the staff of TC really love rubbing salt in your wounds. Will not use again.,7/17/2013,2,0,3,1,1,2
Andrew Wilkes,0,Recently flew LGW to MXP and return over the half term break. Inflight the service was fine. Delayed significantly by weather on the way out but that can happen. What was shocking however was check in at LGW. Yes I know it was half term but it took 90 minutes to do a bag drop simply because their process with very few check in staff saw constant delays as those turning up late for other flights were whisked to the front of the queue. So if you want to avoid a queue arrive late if you like queuing arrive 2-3 hours early. Just ridiculous!,2/24/2015,3,3,3,NaN,2,4
A Snow,0,"I was almost convinced to switch to Delta from US Airways and United where I have status. For 3 of 4 legs of travel the flight attendants and gate agents were friendly and professional and the service was good. This was my second flight on Delta and I was unfamiliar with their seating protocol. On August 8 Flight 5151 from LGA to CLT I asked a flight attendant if the flight was full and if I could move my seat. She did not refuse. Another flight attendant arrived and the two attendants had a less than professional conversation. She then walked up to me with a flight manage at and asked if I was passenger (name) and then said I could not sit in this seat because these seats were Premium. It was a false show. The first attendant could have asked if I'd like to upgrade to Premium or provided an honest response simply saying ""Unfortunately no."" Honesty integrity and professionalism is important.",8/6/2014,3,3,3,0,1,3
Alexandra Bley-Vroman,1,Very satisfactory. Both flights Honolulu-Apia return left on time return flight arrived early. Planes (Boeing 737 3x3) seemed to be in very good condition. Entertainment worked fine TV monitors suspended at intervals no seat-back screens. Full meals were good.,11/9/2011,5,4,4,4,5,9
A McNicol,1,DMK-SGN. First ever flight on the Air Asia group and I was greatly surprised. DMK is great with Air Asia international check in very easy. Plane was new clean and on-time. Crew were relaxed and friendly. The hot seat exit row is money well spent - did not bother with food on such a short leg. I would definitely recommend this airline and will readily use them again.,8/26/2013,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
Andrew-Stuart Catton,1,Flew Business class using Frequent Flyer points upgrade. Aircraft was a brand new 737-800. Leather seat was extremely comfortable. Staff were attentive and very professional throughout the flight. was particularly happy to have in-flight entertainment after travelling on the forward sector with Virgin Australia who offered no IFE at all! Ground service at check in and in the lounge was faultless. A very enjoyable flight. Will definitely be supporting our national carrier by flying Qantas in the future.,12/9/2013,5,5,3,4,5,10
A Solum,1,I give them very high marks for product and service - the only let-down is the seat not going 180-degree flat - which hinders sleep a bit as I tend to slide down. The leg rest is firm and presses on my feet but after all these flights I've worked out a solution - sleeping on my front and I don't seem to slide. Service is great food delicious. Canapes menus done by Le Caprice restaurant in London meal service served properly (no tray service) excellent breads and more. Top of the list goes for lounge at Luton - a haven of comfort. It removes the airport experience and passengers board in a calm and relaxed manner. I understand that EWR lounge is being improved. Only once have I had immigration lines at EWR (and this was due to a computer glitch) never any security issues - another huge boon in using this airline. Improvements and changes are constantly being introduced including better wines different catering re-designed lavatories availability of toothbrush & paste etc. Being a small carrier they can easily react to customer feedback and change things quickly. Great value for money with good levels of friendly service and comfortable seating equals a winning proposition for me! My last flights were 99 out of 100 pax outbound 76 out of 100 inbound - so good loads. From disembarking at LTN last month to car = 17 minutes. Speedy. From landing it was all of 26 minutes.,11/30/2007,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
Alexandre Cazes,1,"YUL-AMM-BKK. Check-in counter opened 1 hour before flight. Gate number announced was wrong and they didn't bother putting the correct number. We had to go though the whole concourse to try to find a RJ staff member that just said ""the flight will be 3 hours late"". During the flight there were 2 babies that did not want to be quiet and staff were not doing anything about it. When a passenger pressed the call button it was very loud so was impossible to sleep. TV at my seat was broken. The staff's answer was ""sorry"". But the second portion of the flight and the return went without issues. Food was great. I recommend this airline overall.",5/23/2013,4,2,5,4,4,8
A McNicol,1,QF52 SIN-BNE then QF8 BNE-SYD in business class on a frequent flyer points redemption so I can't fault value for money. Also impressive were the staff on both legs and the comfort of the business class cabin on both aircraft. Like others comments before the cafe style menu out of Asia on the overnight flights has to go - it is simply not up to business class standard. A tired ham and cheese croissant for breakfast or a small fruit bowl the equivalent of what Silk air provided me in economy class on the connecting flight to Singapore! Contrast this with the full breakfast service on QF8 from BNE to SYD all in a rushed hour and a bit. Qantas proved on QF8 that it can be done. Please bring back real business class food on flights out of Asia!,1/6/2014,5,5,2,3,5,8
Andrey Gerasenkov,1,JFK-KEF-JFK on February 27 and March 3rd. The first leg was on a 757-200 with narrow seats and bad legroom. In addition the aircraft was unbearably hot. Free movies Wi-Fi and food for purchase. FA's nice and attentive. The flight back to JFK was on a 757-300 and both the seats and the legroom were excellent for economy class. This flight was much more comfortable than the outbound leg.,3/6/2014,4,3,3,4,4,7
Andrey Kislyak,1,Ashgabat to Minsk. Brand new Boeing 737-800. Good seat pitch config 3-3 seats are comfortable enough. There are only TV's in the middle of the cabin there is no other entertainment. Flight attendants are very polite. Good value for money comfortable and enjoyable experience overall.,2/18/2015,5,5,4,0,5,8
A Medved,0,"We were supposed to be flying on Ethiopian airlines from the Seychelles on 1st Nov 2013. However due to ""a slight mechanical problem"" the flight was delayed for 48 hours. They refused to rebook us on other flights and kept us waiting for 2 whole days. No update on the situation was given the staff were rude insensitive no one apologized for the delay even more no one bothered to care. They simply disappeared from sight. On the second day they actually took us back to the airport and let us wait there for 7 hours before telling us that the plane had not been fixed yet. All in all we had to spend more than 20 of those 48 hours at the airport. I guess it's fine as long as there are no problems but they are terrible when things go wrong. I'll never fly Ethiopian airlines again. Why they are a member of Star Alliance is a mystery to me.",11/27/2013,1,2,3,1,1,1
Alexandre Valentin,1,Several flights during the last months between Paris Orly and Valencia. Quick check in at both airports. Less strict than other airlines with carry on luggage policy (no checks at check-in or boarding). All flights on time or in advance. Modern A320 with cramped legroom but reclining seats. Nice lounge music played during boarding and landing. Good magazine. You have to pay for food and drinks. Young friendly and well groomed cabin crew. More expensive than Ryanair but better service and luggage policy and principal airports. Also better than Air Europa on the same route which is twice as expensive.,2/1/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,7
A Souts,1,ORD-DUB-ORD. Great service both during the check-in process and onboard on both flights. Very good IFE and decent food. The fact that you have to pay for alcohol is a bit annoying but it is becoming the standard in the industry. Clearing customs in Dublin is a great plus. Overall a very good experience.,5/29/2012,4,4,4,5,4,9
Andrija Matic,1,Over the last 30 days ZAG-AMS-ZAG ZAG-DBV-ZAG and ZAG-IST-ZAG. All flights on airbus 319 with new Reacro seats. Cabin was new and well maintained catering okay flight attendants polite. However each flight was delayed and no explanation was given. The worse was Zagreb to Istanbul return. Each flight was delayed more than two hours and crew as well as customer service acted like it was perfectly normal.,4/2/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,5

Alexei Kosov,1,Connecting flight from Moscow (DME) to Duesseldorf via Riga. Flight attendants and overall service was OK for a discount airline. Had to pay extra charges (approx EUR 25) for choosing seats in the aircraft which was not worth the money paid. Planes (Dash 8 on both routes) were quite new but very noisy. Passport control in Riga airport was a total disaster. Queue was moving extremely slow staff very rude. Flight on the second leg has been delayed for 1.5 hours as the aircraft required some maintenance. Overall impression is not bad but wouldn't recommend anyone to use connecting flights via Riga.,6/21/2013,3,3,3,3,4,4
A Stanton,0,"This is my first experience flying with Delta and I am extremely disappointed. My flight was canceled over 20 hours in advance and I was automatically reassigned to a flight departing 13 hours later. While I appreciate a seat at some point their were 6 flights earlier that I could have been placed on and I was not given a choice. I called Delta and had an associate inform me that I was ""not a priority"" because other flights before mine had been canceled. She also told me my departure weather was the issue she was incorrect. She did absolutely nothing to help me on the phone and was unapologetic. My co-workers on other airlines all departed mostly on time and make it to the same destination I was heading just fine while Delta continued to tell me the weather was not ok. I arrived at the airport at 5am and proceeded to sit in standby flight after flight. As I sit and wait for these flights they are all overbooked by at least 15 seats and I have had several agents act that I am an annoyance when I asked to be put on standby. The attitudes of the agents are generally distasteful and rude. They are treating us as if we are creating the issues and I have offered no apologies on behalf of anyone.",3/9/2015,1,3,3,3,1,NaN
Andrija Maticc,0,TIV-BEG return both flights operated by Fokker 100. Check in and security control at Tivat quick and efficient. Departure to Belgrade was delayed more than three hours. For two hours we were waiting in front of the gate without any explanation. There was no one from Montenegro Airlines to explain delay no airport staff duty free closed no one. After two hours through the loudspeaker we were informed that we will take off when the aircraft arrives from TGD as our plane had technical problems. Finally after we departed selection of soft drinks was served. Aircraft worn out dirty seat belt sign above my seat broken no inflight magazine no emergency situations card pocket in front of my seat. On the other hand legroom great and cabin attendants polite and professional. BEG-TIV leg was operated by the aircraft pretty much in the same condition inflight service the same. On return everything was on time. Departure procedures at BEG and arrival at TIV smooth.,5/7/2007,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Menon,0,Flew them last month from Lusaka-Nairobi and return on old Boeing 767's. While going flight was via Lillongwe and on return via Harare. Both ways seats were broken and quite uncomfortable. Staff were not friendly at all. Cabin and toilets were quite dirty. Food both ways was also horrible. On return in Nairobi check-in staff gave me 2 boarding passes one for the Nairobi-Harare flight and the other for the Harare- Lusaka flight meaning I had to change seats in Harare! Never seen that in any other airline. Recommend to avoid this airline if possible and use alternatives when flying to and from Africa such as SAA/ET.,8/1/2012,2,2,1,0,2,1

A Merchant,0,Flew Toronto to Manchester via Keflavik. Staff were friendly and leg room was adequate in Economy Class. I didn't like the lack of free food on the flight from Toronto so had to sustain myself on tea and coffee. The flight from Keflavik to Manchester wasn't too pleasant with no communication or apology for the delay from staff. We started boarding 15 mins after the scheduled departure time. Icelandair does have a budget feel for a national carrier and would avoid using again.,8/14/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,5
Andy Barker,1,Haven't flown with Virgin for a while but am a flying club member so use miles to upgrade. Flew out to Barbados and back in New Upper Class suite on A330. I've flown both and think both have merits but new design seems slightly more cramped than older version so interested to see what they do for Dreamliner. Both flights were good Gatwick lounge is much more relaxed but still offers a lot pre-flight. Onboard food pretty good and beverages both ways staff good too better on return and new Vera entertainment has a lot of options to keep you busy. Overall same high standard as usual so happy to fly again with Virgin.,6/4/2014,5,4,5,5,4,9
A Starratt,1,"I had a wonderful experience with EVA Air. Staff both on the plane and ground service were helpful, friendly and thoughtful.

Alexnder Youngblood,0,I have traveled with US Airways many times as I live in Asheville NC and the closest major airports are CLT and ATL. Therefore whenever I travel I almost only fly Delta or US Airways. Most recently I flew from CLT to CUN. Although the 757-200 had winglets and the fancy new AA paint job that could not make up for the dissatisfaction I experienced during flight. My seat was very uncomfortable and the cabin was very very dated. There was NO in flight entertainment (not even from the clunky overhead screen). The staff were decent but nothing spectacular. On the way back I flew on an A321 but it felt similar to the 757 I had flown on to CUN. I have flown on every type of plane in the fleet and every plane has this sort of feeling with the exception of the A330 (note: the A330 fleet still feels average when compared to other airlines but is better than every other plane in their fleet. The 767-200s in their fleet are horrible and the A320 family in their fleet is relatively shabby. Regional jets are what you would expect from a regional jet. Overall a horrible airline and as soon as I move out of Asheville to a larger city I plan on using another airline.,2/6/2015,1,1,2,1,3,NaN
A Michaels,1,Flew in Business Class multiple legs from MIA to Santiago/Montivideo. Then Buenos Aires to Lima and Lima to JFK. All flights were on 767's. All flights were on time with clean aircraft extremely spacious and comfortable flat bed type seats excellent white duvets and pillows and an adequate VOD system. Catering was a bit skimpy and of decent quality. The main negative for this airline is the pleasant but almost consistently lazy and indifferent attitude of the cabin crews. The flights to Montevideo were with LAN Chilean crews and they were ok but beyond serving meals and a very long wait for drinks with no refills their presence in the cabin was seldom noted the MIA-SCL leg being 8 1/2 hours. The Peruvian crews on the BUE-LIM-JFK flights could generally be found congregated in the forward galley reading magazines and playing on their computers. They never almost never patrolled the cabin soliciting requests even on the 7 1/2 hour flight between Lima and JFK. However the great seat duvet and on time performance made up for me the poor slow cabin service and mediocre catering.,3/5/2013,3,5,3,3,2,7

A Stells,1,This is the only flight I've taken with Jet (London-Delhi return) and I was really pleasantly surprised. All the cabin crew were friendly and accommodating. The entertainment system is very comprehensive with lots of things to watch and read and the seats were really comfortable. I especially liked the little foot rest sack under the seat in-front. The food was alright definitely better than other airlines but not amazing. Overall I'd definitely recommend Jet.,7/24/2012,4,5,3,5,5,8
Alfonzetti Britny,0,Booked a flight from East Midlands to Aberdeen. Received flight confitmation etc. Yesterday I turned up to the airport after a few days in Nottingham. I was informed they no longer operated that route and I should have been informed of this! I had been rescheduled for a later flight from Birmingham and was put in a taxi to that airport. Ended up at Aberdeen 3 hours later than planned. Incurred extra expenses getting home and my partner made a 150 mile trip to collect me from a flight I wasn't on. I rechecked my emails including junk mail and had received nothing from Flybe informing me of the change to my flight. In fact today I received an email asking me to complete a survey about my flight from East Midlands to Aberdeen!,11/3/2014,1,3,1,0,1,NaN

A Stevenson,1,London Gatwick - Funchal return. Internet check in was a breeze 48 hours before departure. Bag drop at LGW was handled quickly and courteously and although TAP's website stated only one cabin bag was permitted I was allowed to take on a small cabin bag and laptop. Aircraft was an A320 less than half full. Pushback on time and flight time about 3 hrs 15 mins. Cabin crew were friendly albeit largely invisible after breakfast which was a very small savoury roll and yoghurt drink. No personal IFE drop down screens every 4th or 5th row showed a few programs but mostly flight mapping. Return journey from FNC lunchtime departure on a half full A319 pushback 10 minutes early. Snack size hot pasta and fruit puree dessert served midway through the flight. Otherwise pretty much as per the outward journey.,5/13/2013,4,4,2,5,3,7

A Stewart,1,Norwegian charges you for everything. Want to check a bag? Charge. Want something to eat on an international flight? Charge. Want to reserve a seat? Charge. But in the end it was still cheaper than any other airline. We flew on one of the new Dreamliners from Barcelona to Oakland. Most comfortable international flight I've taken. I'm thin and I inevitably leave the plane with sore hipbones and tailbone. This was the first time ever that I left the flight pain-free. Nice seats great to have wifi on the flight good entertainment in a very wide range of recent movies. The food was decent nothing to write home about. I had a good long nap in their comfy seats got some work done and answered emails on my laptop and watched a movie with my husband. Left the plane feeling refreshed.,12/22/2014,5,5,4,5,5,10

Andy Miller,0,"I read past reviews and learned that you need to read their guidelines in advance. I avoided the $100 fee to check in at the gate but still had to pay somewhere between $40 - $50 just for a seat and a carry on bag. Simply getting a seat is extra - this was still OK for me, the total price was still cheap considering I booked the flight a couple days before it left. After reading the reviews I was fully anticipating a 1.5 hour delay, or more. Somehow a miracle occurred and our flight left only 20 minutes late - and we made up those 20 minutes on the flight back. However, flying out of LAX I looked at every other scheduled departures for Spirit and all of them were delayed by at least 2hours. I truly believe that people only complain when things go wrong - I thought maybe this airlines bad reviews are simply because those who get to where they're going with no hiccups never bother writing reviews. With that in mind I had every intention of writing a review, no matter how good or bad the flight went. My flight was good, but the fact that all other flights were delayed by that much scares me. I overheard some of their announcements on further delays, and no explanation was given. I'm not going to fly Spirit again purely for that reason. You know something's wrong when an airline can scare away a traveler for reasons that didn't affect their own flight.",6/17/2015,4,2,1,1,3,6
A Mills,0,"Cancun to Gatwick. After take off many passengers wanted a drink of any sort. Cabin crew told us drinks were only being served with the meal. Service of this meal was very unsatisfactory with alcohol water and meal tray all being presented at the same time. Not a pleasant experience. The meal itself was very second rate too. Stale roll awful salad and rubber dessert. No offer of second drink except the tea/coffee. After meal the trays and rubbish of several rows was not collected and we eventually (along with others) piled this up in separate seats. This waste was not collected until after serving of pre-landing ""snack"". Several hours before landing my partner called for staff as she needed a drink. 45 minutes later no-one had come so she went to where they were and asked for a tea. She was told that breakfast was about to be served so not possible. 30 minutes later ""breakfast"" arrived. ""Breakfast"" was pretty awful and I was very disappointed that this was the Virgin menu. Rock hard and frozen croissant? Only good thing about Virgin now is the entertainment package.",8/11/2013,4,3,1,4,1,3

Inflight entertainment system had good selection of movies and TV shows but less than other carriers. Crew were also very good. Definitely will fly them again.,4/1/2015,5,4,5,4,5,10
A Milossavlyevich,0,TK1843 IST-ATH ticket bought with Aegean. 738 downgraded from 77W very comfortable old leather seats. Catering top-notch the best I have had on a short-haul flight and comparable only with Qatar. FA's proactive and kind a stark contrast with Aegean that followed. Ground staff is deplorable however check-in agents unable to speak proper English. Also Istanbul airport is a disaster: crowded dirty and without free Wi-Fi. A hit and miss experience that decreases once we take into account everything other than the flight itself.,4/14/2015,4,5,5,1,5,7
Andy Wang,1,Bellingham to Las Vegas round trip. Surprisingly the trip to KLAS was really smooth. Our personal item was a bit big width-wise but we got through no problem. Our plane arrived few minutes early the staff were professional and humorous (not expecting that) and the seats weren't that bad. The flight was really smooth. The trip back to KBLI was delayed by an hour because the incoming flight from Bellingham was delayed by the rain and even though the plane was parked in the gate both pilots were on the incoming flight. We made up some time because of strong tailwind (the pilots were trying hard to arrive a few minutes earlier). The pilots landed in the wind smoothly. The only thing I dislike about this airline is that you have to pay to select a seat even upon check-in. When you look at the price tag ($400 for 2 ppl round trip) all those pay drinks could be forgiven even the expensive carry-on. I think that you see all those negative reviews because people who had positive experience took it for granted (though really those delays are horrible to hear). I will travel with Allegiant again and hopefully Allegiant will train more professional crews.,3/27/2014,5,4,0,0,5,9
Ali Muhammad,1,I rode in economy class from YUL to DOH and then back again on the Qatar Airways Boeing 777-300er. Having also tried Saudi Arabian Airlines and Emirates I would have to say that overall (especially in seat comfort) Emirates is the better choice. I would also recommend choosing Emirates for longer flights like YUL to DOH.,3/30/2015,3,2,5,5,5,7
A Storey,1,Great flight. Midnight departure caters for people like me wanting to go to sleep ASAP after takeoff. Seat liner on the seat while I changed. Slept for 7 hours. Entertainment system and food were excellent. The crew were the ones who made the flight so good.,6/25/2015,4,4,4,5,5,10
A Milossavlyevich,1,BUD-IEV and back. My experience of Wizz Air was quite positive since I got acquainted with the airline only this year. On the way there the plane was very comfortable good legroom with real leather seats. Besides the military- type tent used for boarding at BUD the experience was very fine. In Kiev W6 flies to Zhuliany airport which is located right in the urban area making it a really easy and painless transfer unlike KBP which is a lot more distant. On the way back plane 100% full. The pilot seemed in a bit of a haste rough braking after landing that broke the jubilant applause not a single announcement during the flight FA's (or at least one of them) very charming got offered the exit-seat despite being one of the last to board. Recommended although the price is far from competitive on this particular route.,11/12/2014,3,5,0,4,4,5
Angela Bailey,0,Following making my booking with this airline and booking a club class seat the airline changed the plane - which resulted in no club class. Seat Pitch uncomfortable with only 30 inches making a very uncomfortable flight. Inflight sandwich from Girne to Istanbul was good however the inflight meal between Istanbul and Stansted was poor. Staff OK and all were friendly however drinks sold in Euro's and when offered sterling they took the same in pounds as they would have in Euro's. Had the seat pitch been better this would have been a fair airline however the leather seats do not compensate for the restricted leg room for what is in fact a 6 hour flight from London to Girne.,8/21/2006,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
Ali Soufan,0,LHR-DXB via DOH. Both legs of the flights were operated by an aged A340-600. I think Qatar should start thinking of not sending these aircraft's to such long haul routes. Aircraft was very tired from inside and the leg room was awful - so tight. Your flight would be ruined if the person in front reclines their seat as there will no room for you to move or watch. Food was of a very low standard. Coming back again aircraft was an A330-200/300 leg. Frankly speaking the leg room was much better on this aircraft however again old and tired from inside with cabin crew not being attentive to passengers.,4/27/2015,4,3,1,3,3,4

A Suciu,0,Bucharest - Stuttgart return. A pleasant flight enough space for the legs kind stewards. Amazingly ground GermanWings personnel helped us with the queue in front of Baneasa's Passport Control Office in order to urge departure in time. I was positively impressed. We had no delay on both flights. I'll definitely choose again German Wings for my next trip.,5/27/2009,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,4
A Misha,0,Boeing 767-300 Toronto to Warsaw. The good thing about this flight was that we landed safe and on time. The plane was very old little room between seats very uncomfortable. Almost no entertainment they have only one or 2 big screens. The staff was pretty rude some of them refused to speak english; food was poor quality they offer only jus and water for free. For wine and beer they charged 2-5 dollars per drink.,12/28/2011,3,1,1,1,1,5
Alice Rerden,1,We flew LHR-PVG-SYD return and were pleasantly surprised by China Eastern. After reading the reviews we were expecting the worst but the service was good the staff spoke enough English to communicate well and we had our own individual entertainment units with a good selection of recent movies. Three flights were around 10 hours and one was about 13 hours long and on all four we were served 2 full meals (generally a choice of one Asian meal and one Western meal). Seats were comfortable and had a decent amount of space in economy. Only complaints would be that it was not possible to check-in online and that their seat allocation system doesn't seem to seat people that are travelling together next to each other. We were two people booked together and on our PVG-SYD and PVG-LHR flights (which we checked in for over 13 hours in advance as they were our second flights) we weren't given seats together despite specifically requesting it for the return SYD-PVG-LHR flights at the check-in desk. We went to the service helpdesk and the woman was able to change it with no problems so not sure why the original guy couldn't give us seats together. We noticed a number of couples and groups not seated together on the PVG-SYD flight so definitely request it when checking in and follow up at the service desk if still not seated together. Seat configuration on all four flights was 2-4-2.,1/14/2015,3,4,4,4,4,7
A Suleman,0,My sister took the 10.10pm WJ412 flight on Aug 26 from YVR and her flight was delayed 35 mins. Next day my other sister and I took WJ412 at 10.10pm from YVR and again the flight was delayed half an hour. All three of us returned from YEG on Aug 31 on the 4.05pm WJ109 flight - delayed (again) - over 45 mins! We will never fly Westjet again. Part of the delay on Aug 31 was that someone was sitting in our seats - same seat# on Boarding Pass - turns out they had been on the previous flight and no-one bothered to check that they had the next (5pm) connecting flight to YVR and should have got off the plane! They didn't speak much English so it took 15 mins just to get them (4 people) off.,9/10/2014,1,4,3,4,4,1
A Mitchell,1,I was so sceptical of this airline after so many bad reviews but had no choice as I needed a quick reasonable flight to Vegas from Houston. Left 3-1 got to the airport 1 hour 15 mins early. I recommend 1.5 hrs. Staff were friendly and flight left on time. Yes plane seats are tight and the plane was not the prettiest but the flight was smooth and we arrived 10 minutes early. Got bags within 15 minutes of landing and was out of the door. They do nickle and dime you if you let them. We printed our boarding passes at home - no charge paid the lowest fee for bags online in advance $30 for checked ate breakfast before we left and brought a couple of snacks on the plane and did not pay for any of their snacks or drinks. Flight attendants were courteous. My ticket with checked luggage was $107 one way. I already had tix returning on SW so I can only speak to the outbound flight. Do not pick your own seats unless you have small kids other than that you will sit together or people are happy to move around for parties to sit together. Remember no bags over 40 pounds or you pay so pack lightly.,3/7/2014,5,2,1,1,5,4
Angela Chadwick,0,"Adult meals ran out, just sausage and potato left, no children's meals available! Return flight delayed by 7 hours as plane was not in a safe condition. Scheduled flight at 8pm departed at 3.30am! They had to fly one in to Orlando all the way from Cardiff - a bad joke. No children's meals available. ",7/6/2015,1,3,1,5,2,3
Alison Jewitt,0,"Shanghai to Xiamen. The staff were friendly and the flight was fine in general. However if you are over 5' tall DO NOT take a window seat. There is no leg room whatsoever. I'm 5'8"" and wished I'd learned how to say 'aisle-seat' before check-in as it was an incredibly uncomfortable journey made even worse when the person in front tipped there seat back. If I'd had an aisle seat I think it would have been fine though so be warned!",9/5/2006,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Sutherland,0,LHR-MCT-BKK return. Having booked well in advance was annoyed to receive email informing us of schedule change (don't Oman know their schedules for the year?) with two options : cut short trip by three days or extend by one. No offer to compensate for either loss of holiday or extension expense. Online check in is a farce only one sector can be checked in and a seat selected. Ended up row 23 LHR-MCT but row 44 MCT-BKK. Same on the reverse journey row 23 BKK- MCT row 44 MCT-LHR. Of the 8 flights with Oman on this route in the past six months IFE has worked only once. Crew range from attentive to disinterested. Food has taken a nose dive in the last six months. MCT-LHR flight at least 7 rows were denied a drinks service as a 'senior' staff member resented being told she had forgotten to do it and sulked. For the first time ever had to use the call button to ask for a drink with meal and get IFE reset after a promise to rectify went undone. Have used Oman Air's OnAir product successfully once. Good wifi speed but at $29.95 its very expensive. Decided to treat ourselves to OnAir on the MCT-LHR (longest leg). Worked fine for 20 minutes then crashed and crew couldn't have cared less. Oman is great when its good and absolutely appalling when its bad. The planes are new so they say. Am going to give Oman one last try in October.,4/24/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,4
A Mola,1,Bangkok to Singapore on 30/1/13. Easy check in at Don Muang airport and was given an aisle seat as requested. Friendly airline staff and a good selection of food on sale. A little different to the grumpy lot on my next flight on Qantas from Singapore to Sydney.,2/8/2013,4,4,4,0,5,7
Alison Thomas,1,"My husband and I were most impressed. We travelled for the first time to Ibiza and found them to be very reliable efficient and organised. The cabin crew were friendly and helpful and gave a warm welcome on board and a friendly goodbye when we disembarked. We are both tall (I am 5ft 11"" and my husband is 6ft 3"") and we found the seats comfortable with ample leg room. We enjoyed the inflight snack service and had a delicious tapas box and a full 70 cl bottle of white wine - something which no other airline seem to offer! We used the free wi-fi service too - what a great idea! We would definitely use Norwegian again and have been recommending you to friends and family. We were very satisfied customers!",7/1/2013,4,4,4,0,4,10
Angela Hampton,1,Travelled with Monarch from Dalaman 18 June 2013 to Leeds Bradford Flight number ZB7535 and vice versa 8 June flight ZB7534. Excellent plane very clean and modern. Staff really good. Well informed. Everything we needed. Comfortable. Only negative was too many kids running round as plane half empty was a real nuisance and not relaxing.,6/21/2013,4,4,4,0,5,9
A Swamy,1,BLR-BOM on the early morning flight. Cabin was clean. FAs attentive and courteous. We had pre-booked snacks and served a good Veg Sandwich and juice. Quite good. Other choices too were available.,3/19/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
Angela Johnson,0,Original flight was scheduled to depart at 10.30 am from DFW. Flight delayed too many times to count. Right now we are at 4 hours past (2.30 pm) I am on the plane have been sitting here with no air flow or electricity for about an hour. We were told that the flight crew was coming from OK however all the passengers from OK are on board and the flight attendants said they could not find pilots. This type of incompetence and lack of communication does not instil a lot of confidence in my safe arrival at my final destination. Although AA was $100 cheaper than United I will never fly with AA again.,4/14/2015,1,1,1,1,3,1
Alistair Baker,1,I treated myself to Premium Economy on my PEK-LHR flight BA38 because it was only an extra Â£120 and I had been on holiday to North Korea and wanted a bit of luxury. I was impressed with the legroom in the bulkhead seat and the PE cabin was not very full. The cabin crew were polite and attentive and the food was good however it seemed to be the same as the Economy food just with a fancy menu card. I was impressed with the seat recline and the footrest and I got a lot of sleep even though it was a daytime flight. The IFE malfunctioned for the first half of the flight which seems a common occurrence on BA 747s. Staff were apologetic and gave us complaint forms to fill in.,5/31/2015,4,5,3,2,5,8
A Swan,0,I had an Air France ticket from Paris CDG to Melbourne. The second leg of the flight from Guangzhou to Melbourne was operated by China Southern. There were no personal television screens only shared screens which screened movies with illegible English subtitles. The lack of in-flight entertainment made this 9.5 hour flight dull and unpleasant. The food was the worst I have had on an airline: for dinner I chose noodles with beef the beef was a couple of tiny pieces of mince. My partner chose the chicken with rice and although the rice had a nice flavour there was hardly any chicken. The only decent meal on the flight was the omelette and hash brown which I chose for breakfast. The seats were also of a very poor standard. The headrests did not contain the function which allows you to push two flaps inwards in order to stop your head from lolling about when you fall asleep. I have had these adjustable headrests on other economy-class flights including the flight with Air France from Paris to Guangzhou and flights with Etihad Airways and Qantas. In addition the armrests between the seats could not be pushed all the way upwards and consequently my partner and I were unable to lean on each other without hitting our faces on the protruding armrest. The absence of personal in-flight entertainment and the extremely poor quality of the food and the seats compared with other economy-class flights means I won't be flying with China Southern again.,8/28/2013,3,2,1,1,3,1
A Moor,0,We flew from Heathrow to Dubai on an Airbus 380 early in December 2013 on this trip they ran out of food choices and I was told that I could not get the chicken that I had asked for. The flight crew were harassed and totally disorganized. When we few back in March 2014 exactly the same thing happened - sorry we have run out of the choice you asked for on the menu. Also my headphones were not working after having had the light on for about two hours I eventually got up and went to the crew to ask for another one. Emirates prides itself on good service and this was not the case on the Airbus. We flew from Dubai to Johannesburg and back on a 777 and I cannot fault the service on these planes.,4/1/2014,4,4,1,4,1,6
Angela Shiromani,0,The only airline I've flown where the cost for my luggage (30 Euros per Kg of weight over the first 20 kg for each leg of my flight) cost more than my ticket. I paid over $700 of luggage cost from Vilnius to Paris. This is exorbitant. I will never fly this airline again. If they had just suggested I pay more to upgrade to business class which has a bigger baggage allowance I could have overall paid far less and travelled more comfortably.,6/8/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN

A Tabb,0,After a 4 hour flight from Manila to Inchon and a 6 hour layover I boarded the plane to see my window seat taken by a family with children. They pointed to the child and not wanting to be inconsiderate I took their middle seat in another aisle. I told the hostess I wished a window seat. She said she would get back to me after boarding. Even after I was served a special dietary meal and explained this isn't my seat and I was still waiting for a window I was never moved or given an explanation. Last time I use this airline.,6/25/2013,2,1,3,5,1,1
A Moreitz,1,I have had the opportunity to compare several carriers from SYD to FRA and DUS in Economy over the past few years and have just returned with CX from Europe for the first time. The words that come to mind are 'budget' and 'inconsistent service standards'. HKG to FRA return was a vastly different experience from SYD to HKG. On the way to Europe I reserved low fat meals and to say the food amounts were tiny (I am not big nor am I a huge fan of stuffing myself on planes) and certain elements of the meal service were non-existent compared to the regular fare would be an understatement. It was so mediocre that I decided to get the normal food offerings on the way back. One of the meal offerings from HKG to SYD which was a Beef Consume and can only be described as pieces of beef thrown into a clear flavourless broth with white rice was inedible. I am not the fussy however some things I noticed is that there were no hot towels only in premium economy CX are one of the few airlines who only allow 20kgs of checked baggage whereas all competitors TG/SQ/EK/BA allow more and the in season fruit salad consisted of about a handful of tiny pieces of Apple/Rock and Water Melon and soft drinks are poured out of bottles instead of receiving small cans. Apart from the fact that staff on the planes virtually never smile whilst serving passengers at least that was consistent. Furthermore 2 main meals were served within 3 hours of one another on a 9.5 hour flight back to Sydney. Why? When questioned I was told it was company policy. This resulted in not having any food for the last 5 hours to Sydney. Unlike SQ I also didn't notice on board staff helping or caring much about mothers with their young babies either. Now the good bits: Staff are very quick efficient and were always around throughout the flights with drinks and baskets of good snacks throughout FRA-HKG return not so much during SYD-HKG. Ice cream for dessert on two sectors was most welcome. The seats are very comfortable pitch is better than on paper leg room is very good each seat has a USB charger and the entertainment system is one of the easiest most enjoyable I have used although the movie /tv selection was not as vast as on some other carriers. Ground staff at all airports were also most helpful friendly and efficient. Had to unexpectedly break my trip in HKG and ground staff went out of their way to help me.,12/31/2014,4,5,3,4,4,7
Alistair Peckham,0,ABZ-LHR the connecting to UA. Check-in had to be done at the kiosk then drop luggage point. Was a bit pointless as the agent had to re-check me in. On the plus side they did not charge me for excess baggage weight which was over 7 kgs. Flight was delayed due to fire alarm at the airport which left an hour late. EMB145 operated by regional forgot how small it was. Onboard service nil. Flight crew were very informative and in the end reduced the delay only to 30mins once we arrived at LHR.,4/23/2012,3,4,0,0,4,7
Angelica Roldan ,1,"Aeromexico has recently restarted its flights to Toronto, I had a nice experience flying with them that started with a half price sale ticket. I thought that having bought my ticket so cheaply and being in the lowest cabin class, the flying experience would not be very good, but I was surprised by the kind attention of the stewardesses and also by a tasty breakfast in the morning. Only flaws in the flight was that the flight arrived half an hour late, maybe due to turbulance, the seats are a bit uncomfortable and the audio did not work, but as it is a 5 hours night flight only, that did not bother me much.",6/13/2015,5,3,5,NaN,5,1
A Tams,1,Flew from EMA to AGP on Monday 5th May and returned Saturday 10th May. Both flights were ahead of schedule customer service from the cabin crew was great even though we didn't purchase anything onboard. Seating was as expected flights were almost full both ways and noisy with disobedient children. It was our first flight with Ryanair but I can say that we would fly them again we are hardened BA fans for both short and long haul and will travel hours out of our way to London just to fly them but Ryanair will definitely be given consideration next time we book a short haul flight.,5/11/2014,4,3,1,NaN,4,7
Allan Anderson,0,I have made the Qantas flight from Wellington to Sydney sixteen times in the last year flying Business Class. The food was consistently poor. The inflight service was excellent. Inflight entertainment was excellent. Have a good meal before departure.,5/31/2015,2,5,1,5,5,2
Angelo Comazzetto,0,"Flight 1899 on May 9th. The airline might be marketing this as low cost but it is certainly low cost for them and not the passengers. I got ""rouged"" on a ""business"" flight from Las Vegas and thought for a second I was on Ryanair or Air Berlin. In business they took the Lufthansa short haul idea of simply blocking the economy seat off next to you. The flight attendant told me after we took off that I would need an app on my phone (how can I get that in flight?) and then halfway through the flight offered me an iPad to use after I complained this was pretty silly. It wasn't cheaper it wasn't good it was all around terrible. I guess it helps AC make their sales number but it sure doesn't help the passengers in any way. Maybe if it was 50% less than what it is now it might be worth a look. Steer clear!",8/15/2014,1,1,1,1,1,1
Allan Cousins,1,May 2014 we two middle aged Australian couples travelled Singapore to Paris and return five weeks later in June 2014 Rome to Singapore. Both flights business class and via Colombo as a transit. SriLankan airlines would equal other business class airlines especially Australian business class operatives. The staff were happy to attend to anything and actually looked happy to be doing their job. Aircraft clean and check-in staff that don't consider you an inconvenience. My phone call to Singapore reservations were promptly returned. As a well travelled semi retired couple we would recommend and travel again with SriLankan Airlines if they coincide with our destinations.,7/3/2014,5,5,4,4,5,10
A Morgan,0,I have been a Southwest customer for years and have rarely had problems. Today I was trying to get home for Thanksgiving. I have signed up to get text messages about the status of my flights and until today this has worked out fine. Until today I have received text messages informing me of flight delays which turned out to be accurate. Today I received 2 successive texts telling me that my flight was being delayed first from the original departure time of 5.25pm until 6.00pm and then of a further delay until 6.20pm. When I arrived at my gate about one hour before the scheduled departure time there was no seating available in the area of the gate from which my flight was leaving. I moved to an area of the concourse where the gates are not currently being used so I could sit and elevate my feet. I was actually sitting there when the second text came telling me of the delay until 6.20pm. At 6.10 I got up and walked down to my gate. When I arrived I discovered that the plane had actually departed at 5.50 before I received the second text. When I spoke with the person at the Customer Service desk I was told that I should not have left the gate and that the announcement that the plane was actually leaving at the originally scheduled time could not be heard in the area where I had been sitting. When I asked why I had received a second text message telling me of a further delay after the flight had actually left I was told that the texts are computer generated and are for my convenience only. I was aware that the plane might actually depart later than the time given in the text message but it had never occurred to me that it might depart earlier than the time predicted by the texts. I was told that my options were to wait for ten next flight which was due in about two hours fly to Baltimore for a layover then fly to Nashville and arrive at my destination a little before mid-night or pay for a hotel room and take a flight in the morning. I could not face several more hours of great discomfort so I am spending tonight in the Microtel without luggage or medication.,11/29/2013,0,0,0,NaN,0,NaN

Allan Gathercoal,0,Santa Cruz Bolivia to Sao Paulo Brazil. At the airport check-in was easy. It pays to arrive early and avoid the impending line. The counter staff was friendly and they did not charge me for my extra weight (about 4 kilos). I was impressed by the new 737 that Aerosur used on this leg - most AeroSur flights use older 727.

Angus Clark,0,SYD-PEK-GAT flight sold as a single stop. Only after further enquiries (after purchase) did I find that there was a technical stop in Shanghai. 40 minute stop was taken and little to no information was given to passengers. Did we have to clear customs and then come back in? Yes we did. We were not told. It took me about 70 minutes to get back to the gate. After this we sat on the tarmac for a while. Initially the blame was levelled at tardy passengers that meant we lost our place in the queue. Then the weather. This is while other aircraft were taking off and landing. Of course the delay meant we missed our connecting flight. Again information had to be squeezed out of the staff. The layover was at a local hotel. We did not know we were being rescheduled until 5 minutes before being ushered onto the bus. Still no replacement flight had been communicated to us. I am currently awaiting the check in to open for the rescheduled flight. To their credit this morning information has been easier to gather.,6/3/2013,0,3,3,3,2,1
A Telman,1,IAH-MEX-IAH economy. First leg on B738 and E190 on the way back.

Allan L Agerholm,0,Was due to fly from Marrakech to Morocco to catch connecting flight to Copenhagen. On arrival at Marrakech airport learned that flight was cancelled. No staff available and no information forthcoming. After a while was shepherded into a filthy bus which was in a horrible state with basic safety equipment such as seatbelts and emergency hammers missing. After a hot 3 hour bus ride (A/C not working) arrived at Casablanca airport only to find that airline had not informed of our delay due to their own cancelled flight and s gate closed and flight due to depart. Found an airline rep after a while and miraculously flight dep. was delayed and we boarded. Inflight service extremely poor. Not enough food; not enough drinks and only one service on a 3.5 hour flight with no possibility to buy further. Staff ignorant and disinterested. Toilets filthy and smelly.,10/5/2014,1,2,1,1,1,1
A Telman,1,URA to LHR return via DME. Check-in online fine. Personnel on baggage drop off both at URA and LHR (staffed by BMI) helpful and efficient. Planes are a bit on an older side but were okay and legroom in economy premium is good although seats were just what you expect from any regular Y-class seat - not premium at all. DME-LHR on 738 with airshow displaying the aircraft still in yellow TUI livery! b767-300ER on return from LHR - okay leg room and they were showing a film but NO headphones on offer! Food not bad but not too good either but FA's are very efficient and friendly. Overall an average carrier which however takes you from A to B safely and on time. I would recommend this carrier for good fares and will use them again.,9/21/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,6
Angus Travji,1,"Flew on a new Qantas 737-800 with a very nice ""retro"" livery. The staff were very helpful, the plane had a very modern interior with LED lights and larger windows. The food was impressive and tasty, the seat wasn't too comfy but it had an excellent inflight entertainment system and a very generous sized tray table. ",7/3/2015,4,3,5,5,5,9
Allan Robins,1,CPT-BFN-CPT. Cannot fault this low cost carrier departed on time fair legroom on way out much better on return with an emergency seat. Snacks on board were reasonable cost though Mango was let down by the airport baggage claim at both ends. By far the worst was Bloemfontein having to wait just short of 45 minutes. Taking into account that the Mango plane was the only plane there and that it was a 2 min walk from the plane to the baggage reclaim I was sorely tempted to walk back to the plane and get the bag off myself. As for Cape Town there were 4 conveyors to pick from but they loaded/mixed the bags on the conveyor that had baggage from another flight hence major confusion. Not Mango's fault but they should be nagging the airports to get heir acts together,2/1/2009,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
A Theseira,1,SIN-NRT-LAX vv everything went well. I was personally escorted from gate to gate without having to run in Narita. The ground staff were efficient and very polite. The service onboard was excellent - meal portions huge and seat space comfortable. The Japanses Bento box meals were delicious. While their PTV was limited its better to have something to watch than nothing at all. Toilets on board were kept very clean.,9/30/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
Anil Sinanan,0,Delayed from 8am to 6pm on Friday 3rd August in Barbados on the way to St Vincent due to tropical storm. Don't mind the waiting but do mind the total lack of information. No LIAT rep was interested or knew anything. SVG to Barbados on Sunday 5th - friends bag never arrived on flight (apparently this is quite common) so landed in London with no luggage. Bag eventually arrived two days later. Bring on the competition for this airline please as they are a monopoly: prices are high service is appalling and its 50/50 whether the flight will actually leave on time if at all and whether your luggage will arrive.,8/16/2012,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
Allen Bishop,1,Los Angles to Tocumen and back and was completely satisfied. The 737's were in top shape inside and out. Food was typical airline fare but the service was excellent. Cabin crew were polite but they need more English speaking personnel. Seating was tight so placement at the central Exit door was appreciated on the return flight. I will definitely use them again.,3/9/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Thomas,0,On booking I was given no alternative but to take a full-fare economy flight FRA-ARN with SAS on Mon 25 August if I wanted to return that evening. I was told on check-in at La Paz that it had been upgraded to Business Class which would have been welcomed after 26 hours travelling on two international sectors earlier. On boarding flight SK638 at FRA I found the seats to be exactly the same size and configuration as in economy class and every seat was to be occupied i.e. including the middle ones or all 15 seats. Yet the economy cabin itself was only one- third full and there were many rows with no passengers at all. Why was I then forced to pay a full-fare economy to fly that evening? We at SAS Plus were offered an alternative of either a chicken or cheese sandwich only and only then asked if we wanted anything else. When I asked what else was available I was shown the menu turned specially to the pages listing snacks with prices which I declined considering it an insult on business class of a non-budget airline. Yet I saw about 4-6 full-meal trays handed to an economy flight attendant. The meal clearance was conducted within 10 minutes of the completion of the meal serving. Soon after I spotted the business class attendants in the galley eating a full-meal tray each. Later I noticed that this was the evening meal on the menu which was meant as complimentary for business class (SAS Plus) passengers. Why were the flight attendants - including those in economy cabin - eating our meal entitlement never even having offered it to us? Shameful behaviour! The menu in-flight magazine and safety card were dog-eared and very old looking. The male flight attendant in business class had not shaved that morning - which is quite different from having trimmed facial hair. These are small symptoms of an airline in decline. I think SAS could understudy Thai Airways even though decades ago Thai had understudied SAS.,8/28/2014,1,1,1,1,1,1
Anish Patil,1,Cochin to Mumbai. I As it is a low-fare airline you have to buy food or drinks onboard but prices seem reasonable. The plane seemed clean.

A Morse,0,PHX-JFK. Everything on time overnight flight. Standard JB service. Chatty flight attendants in the back made it hard to sleep. I don't feel like the seat is that great the back support is good but I think the seat bottom is thin. Arrival into JFK early.,9/10/2011,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,6
Allen Kari,0,22 July we flew Dragonair to connect with Cathay 0135 from Hong Kong to Melbourne. We missed our connection and began a 48 hour ordeal exacerbated by poor customer service a lost bag airline transfers that left us sandwiched between babies and high school kids on Thai Airways into Sydney with a seven hour wait before we boarded a flight into Adelaide. All together this was a horrible trip. Cathay has promised to be in touch but we're home four days and nothing. Let's face it - an airline is about what happens both in the air and on the ground. Disappointing.,7/31/2014,1,2,2,3,1,1
Anita Badwal,0,Monarch airlines are too basic. Although we had issues Monarch made our 3 hour journey to Corfu in August very dull and boring. No entertainment no blankets or pillows on night flights and the food had no variety and was a rip off. Whilst sitting on the flight waiting to leave we saw our luggage being taken off the plane then later we were told they had put the our luggage in another plane and theirs on ours so had to wait for the swap! Lovely staff though and great pilots.,9/22/2014,1,1,1,1,5,1
A Thompson,0,My mother and I flew from Sharm to Cairo return. I thought we would be boarding an Egyptair flight - unfortunately not.

Anita Sulley,0,Just returned from Rome to Toronto. Never again! We have travelled extensively on many different airlines and this is the worst I have seen. The aircraft was old and dated. A few old video screens spread so far apart that most couldn't see - that's if you wanted to watch Spider Man 2. This was a 9.5 hour flight and we were served a tiny dried up pasta dish and a glass of house wine - not individual bottles like most have. The next service was 7 hours later a tiny dry muffin and the same little bag of crackers we had at dinner - no water service throughout the flight. The aircraft smelt and the wash rooms filthy. The guys next to me had a table tray that was cracked in two and his seat was in a permanent recline position. Couldn't check in online so had to bear the mobs and check in at the counter!,9/24/2014,1,1,1,1,2,1
Allen Wood,1,Edinburgh to Faro both ways on time the plane was clean and the cabin staff excellent. My problem started when we came out to the foyer of Faro airport and there was no rep to tell us where to find the transfer coaches and then we spotted this small wooden sentry box stuck away in the corner with a dim light on the top where we eventually were told where to go. I have travelled abroad 60 times all over the world and this is the worst customer service I have had.,6/7/2013,3,4,4,NaN,4,9
A Thorley,1,"I have flown with Jet2 since it began and have generally had a really good experience but over the past couple of years we have had our seats changed without being informed. I use wheelchair assistance and always book early to get the seats we want. We are now frequently being moved way down the plane and on one occasion put on separate rows. Only when I query the matter, by which time it is almost impossible to change them do I get the seat pre-booking fee refunded. I feel I have been 'fobbed off' regarding this matter.",6/11/2015,4,3,4,1,4,8
A Mueller,1,SEA-KEF-SEA in Economy. Onboard seats were comfortable and pretty good leg room. IFE was on- demand and worked perfectly. You have to pay for food in Economy but considering how inexpensive the ticket was ($950 for two people round trip) and that almost all US airlines make you do the same for flights almost as long I didn't mind. Cabin crew were nice and efficient service. Return flight was the same except delay slightly longer due to weather at KEF and I was able to get an emergency exit row that had great leg room. I like that Icelandair doesn't charge you for checked baggage or exit row seating. Icelandair is better than any US airline save Hawaiian.,2/15/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
Anjuli Nielsen,0,"First flight was over 3 hours delayed, we were given non refundable â‚¬20 coupons for the next flight on Vueling - that we will not be booking. Arrived in Barcelona, promised we would be on the next flight to our final destination. We were not permitted on the next flight. The line for Vueling customer service was huge and unmoving, except of course when people gave up and left. Staff were rude and unreasonable, unwilling to help those that they had seriously inconvenienced. We have spent over 9 hours waiting for Vueling to get their act together as I write this review.

Allison Jarrett,1,Flew from YYC-EWR-YGK-YYZ-YYC. Flight left on time. It was 60% full mostly people on business but for me it was vacation. Got some apples and some noodle soup. The soup was salty but fine and the apples were surprisingly good. The inflight entertainment system was good and tons of choices. Flight from YGK-YYZ was a 1-1 configuration which was different and no drinks served but only a 50 minute flight and no flight attendant or cockpit door. Flight from YYZ-YYC was an A320 and same entertainment system but the flight attendants gave all the kids on the plane ice cream and cookies left over from the Executive Class passengers.,11/25/2013,5,4,3,4,4,9

A Toney,1,MES-CGJ flight was memorable due to the excellent service surprisingly good meal and most of all the polite professional FA's. Collectively the level of English comprehension as used/spoken by the FA's was much higher than that on domestic competitors. Inflight magazine was excellent of high quality and useful. Although the flight did not leave on time the pilot made up the time arriving in Jakarta some minutes before scheduled. Garuda's domestic route is excellent service very good if only their domestic fares would match that of the main competitors it would wipe the floor with them. Compared to 2009/2010 the Garuda online booking website is vastly improved and user friendly. I fervently hope Garuda will soon return to the LAX-CGJ route.,7/23/2013,4,4,5,0,5,9
Ann Chung,0,First and last time flying them. First time visiting Shanghai choose HX because of their departure time (Friday night back Sunday night). From HKG to Shanghai our departure time was supposed to be 9pm and land at 11.30pm. As we got to the departure gate we were waiting to be called but it was 9.30pm and there was no announcement ground staff told us delay was due to typhoon after 5mins we got onboard but we were kept waiting (no announcements from Pilot). Told we would take off at 11pm plane landed at 1.15am. On the flight back from Shanghai to HKG departure time 9.10pm we were informed there would be no delay but again there was a long time waiting at the departure gate. Got onboard at 10.15pm and after doors were closed there was no signs of push back. At 11.30pm we finally took off and landed at 2.15am.,8/6/2013,0,3,2,2,3,1
Allison Scott,0,"I have travelled to the USA on many occasions mainly to visit family and go on shopping sprees. I mainly use United Airlines as I always found them to have competitive prices and good baggage allowances. However on my last few trips the free baggage allowance was reduced from two bags to one. Last week my bag was only 4 lbs overweight and I was charged the enormous amount of $200. I realise that there are reasons for charging for overweight bags, but there are plenty customers who are overweight and are not charged extra for seats and there was also lots of youngsters travelling with 2 large pieces of hand luggage struggling to carry bags along the aircraft walkway. I think it's wrong that an average size and weight customer gets charged a huge amount for a 4lb overweight bag.",7/27/2015,3,3,3,3,3,5

Although a lot of the inflight amenities kit were not located in front of the seat (only slippers were) when I asked for them (eye mask stocking earplugs water spray etc.) staff will bring them to you. All the toiletries were well-stocked in the bathrooms. Between meals there was a list of snacks I could choose from. I am most impressed with Korean Air.,3/20/2012,5,4,0,5,5,9
A Trites,0,The worst long distance flight I have experienced - Toronto to Venice (flew Air Canada from Vancouver to Toronto). The trip from Toronto could not have been more unpleasant from staff to seating entertainment and meals. Unable to see steward giving safety information (no video equipment). Dinner was delivered consisting of pasta which had freezer burn with a tough and flavourless beef stew on top. No choices. Drinks were not offered. Managed to get some water. Breakfast was 1/2 piece of banana loaf. Coffee came in tiny cups - no refills ever offered even after request. Seats cramped - no personal control of air conditioning etc. Very cold in our section. If I had wanted to watch anything I would have had to rent an I-pad for $10 since I do not own one. Crew seemed to do a required task and then totally disappear. They were not in any way gracious or helpful. My carry on was specifically purchased to meet all the restrictions of this flight but could not fit either under the seat or in the overhead bin. I could have done this flight on another airline and wish to heaven I had - the cost would have been the same or at most only very little more. Never again! I have tried over the years to be a supporter of Air Canada and although I have had some flights which were less than advertised this one was unbelievably awful and Air Canada does not deserve any kudos for their 'discount' (not) airline!,11/17/2014,1,1,1,1,1,1
Ann Marie MacMillan,0,Recently returned from Costa Rica flight was on time there and back very old plane uncomfortable small seats only one movie to watch.

Almassad Ahmad,0,Amman to Cairo and Cairo to Copenhagen. By far the worst airline I have experienced the flight was delayed from Amman with no explanation given. When we finally boarded into the flight the staff did not even smile let alone make conversation with passengers. As a vegetarian I was shocked to know that they have no vegetarian options and the female attendant gave me a dry response by saying that its not their fault that I am a vegetarian. While leaving the plane all the cabin crew did was give passengers an icy stare - no smile or thank you. Its such a shame about the cabin crew because the flight was otherwise very clean modern with plenty of legroom and comfortable seats.,1/23/2015,1,4,1,2,1,NaN
A Naidu,0,My experiences with Air Pacific staff have been lacking in dignity professionalism and basic courtesy. I have seen an air-hostess roll her eyes and 'tch' at a young boy because he stopped her to ask for another drink. I walked to the galley to ask for a second drink. The female attendant picked up a glass that already had something in it and proceeded to put ice in it. I made a point of asking for a fresh glass. Her response was immediately sarcastic 'oh you don't want this one..okaaay' and when she handed me my 'fresh' glass remained with her back to me while continuing her conversation with her colleague. Shabbiness has become common behavior. On my flight outbound to Fiji FA sounded and behaved like it bored her to be there. I understand everyone has a bad day but this has been my experience often.,2/16/2012,3,3,1,3,1,2
Ann Scott,0,"You can only carry a purse or a small backpack not a carry on. A ""carry on"" is an additional $50. All refreshments are for purchase. To choose your seat is an additional $18. To get a boarding pass from a representative at the counter is an additional $10. I flew to Houston from LA. For my returning flight 2 of the 4 kiosks were out of service to self check in. I had to wait in the same line as the people that were paying for all of their baggage and get boarding passes trying to avoid the $10 fee. My flight was at 11.25 I got to the kiosk at 10.41 and my pass wouldn't print. I get to the representative and he tells me I've missed my flight that leaves 40 minutes later. I had to check in by 10.40. They had no more flights leaving that day and the next day's flight was oversold. (What airline only has one flight to Los Angeles). They couldn't book me on another flight for 2 days. I had to buy a same-day one-way ticket on another airline or wait 2 days to get home. I will never fly Spirit again. The fair is not cheaper. By the time you're finished purchasing all the things you'll need a fair ends up as much as if not more than any of their competitors.",9/6/2014,1,1,1,1,1,1

The flat bed on this newly refurbished A330 was reasonably wide and there was plenty of space for hand luggage. Food was good and service was excellent. Only complaint was not with CX but with the Qatar Airport - on both my inbound and outbound flights the aircraft was requested to park miles and miles away from the terminal and the airport bus took well over 20 minutes to transport passengers to and from the aircraft.,4/8/2014,5,5,5,4,5,9

But once in Oslo there was a huge mess. All flights were cancelled thousands of passengers all over baggage lost. We could not reach our final destination and nobody could tell us what happen with the luggage. We had to queue to two different counters for 6 hours in total to be told that ""employees were going home"" that they did not know how to handle the mess and that we were invited to exit the airport and find an accommodation by ourselves! All was booked in Oslo nobody could find accommodation and we ended up sleeping on the floor of the airport. They did not offer any water any voucher no communication from the airlines so far.

The airline wrote stating ""you can't order a special meal as we only serve snacks no meals on short flights within Europe."" I was flying business so I was surprised to get such an answer. I provided the airline with my booking number when I contacted them so they saw my booking details. Other than that the flights were great members of the crew onboard were friendly and knew what they were up to. Great service onboard not as good ground service at GVA.

They also served complimentary breakfast which was a decent omelette. Cabin staff was friendly and professional. We left and arrived on time. I had a 3-hour layover before taking a flight to Toluca (at a bargain fare) and asked Cancun check-in staff if I could change that leg of the trip to MEX. I was switched to an earlier CUN-MEX flight at no extra charge. The aircraft from CUN to MEX was brand new and spotlessly clean. We left and arrived on time.,1/2/2014,5,4,3,3,4,8
A Tyler,0,My partner and I were due to get married in Vancouver in September 2013 and we thought we would go the extra mile and fly Virgin. A month later I get an email from Virgin saying the flights had been cancelled and they could now not fly us out until the 3rd September. I phoned their customer services department and was told there was nothing they could do. After 30 minutes they eventually agreed to upgrade us to premium economy for the flights on 3rd which I accepted. On 3rd Sep we arrived at the airport and on check-in I mentioned the upgrade. Told only one of us could have the upgrade. There was no way my partner and I wanted to be separated for a 10 hour flight. He said there was nothing he could do there was only room for 1 of us so we were stuck in economy. The flight crew supervisor came over and explained she knew what had happened and was very apologetic. She said there was not room for both of us in premium economy but that her and the cabin crew would give us the premium service where we were sat to try and make the flight better. I have to say the staff were brilliant. They could not do enough. They brought my partner and I champagne before we even took off. They then continued to top our glasses up with champagne for the entire flight. We were given our first choice of meals and our meals first and when we landed the flight crew have us another bottle of champagne to take with us. Fantastic service and flight from that crew. I then telephoned customer services to complain and I was told they will now give us the upgrade on the way home which when we got to the airport they again said there was no room for us in premium economy and we weren't upgraded as agreed. We will not be flying virgin again.,9/25/2013,2,3,3,3,1,5
Alvarez Maarit,0,Had a two leg journey on TAP: Lisbon - Dakar June 25. At check-in in Helsinki was informed that the flight will be delayed for at least 3 hours. It ended up being delayed 8 hours and no representative was available to assist at the gate until much later - a 10 euro food coupon was issued! No talk of being sent to a hotel while waiting. As a result of this delay I arrived in Lisbon at 2.30 am local time and despite assurances no-one met the arrivals who were transferring to other flights until several hours later. An agent shuffled various new flight coupons but there were none for our family. Obviously we had missed the continuing TAP flight hours before bound for Dakar. Now at Lisbon airport no hotel room was available and we were not allowed access to a lounge either. We were each given a breakfast and lunch coupon and I was given phone cards as I had no way of communicating to Dakar that we were delayed. My family ended up spending an entire day at the airport and the next flight to Dakar moreover took off 2 hours later than scheduled. The total waiting time in Helsinki and Lisbon was 24 hours.,8/20/2014,1,0,0,0,0,NaN
Anna Dixon,0,"Communication is non-existent. We got a text the morning of our flight out telling us that there was a 5 hour delay. Fortunately we looked online for other flights and discovered our flight was ontime - we never got another text, if we hadn't looked, we would have missed the flight. Got to the airport and after waiting awhile looked to see there was a 2 hour delay. OK, all airlines have delays now and then - no big deal. The customer service though was miserable, they never made any sort of announcement. It is important to note that the plane was about half empty. I assume that is because the text told everyone that it was delayed 6 hours. Family was meeting in Las Vegas, their flight was cancelled and Spirit would do nothing for them - would not even get them on a flight the next day. They requested a refund for the outgoing flight and without them asking Spirit refunded both flights and would not allow them to fly home either (even though that flight was not cancelled). It cost several hundred dollars to book on a different airline. This airline does nothing to help their customers when they cancel flights and they do it all the time.",6/20/2015,1,1,NaN,NaN,1,1
A Nelson,0,"There will be additional fees. You will have to pay for your baggage (both checked and carry-on). Your seat will not be guaranteed unless you pay a minimum of $8 to select your seat. Frontier has a strategy of overbooking presumably to ensure full flights. Every day groups of these extra passengers are forced into later flights. ""Check-in is 45 minutes prior to departure"" means that you will be charged $75 and forced into the next flight if you do not check-in 45 minutes prior to departure. Frontier is the only airline that pulls their employees from the check-in counter and shuts down their check-in computers 45 minutes before departure to ensure that you will not be allowed in if you arrive late. I was running late to my flight this morning and called Frontier's 1-800 number at the suggestion of the friendly JetBlue check-in folks as Frontier's counter had recently been abandoned. I manoeuvred my way through the expected automated system and finally reached a woman who handled my situation with the patience and understanding of a grizzly woken from hibernation. I was interrupted and rudely instructed to be quiet and listen to the rules before rebooking my flight. By the way this airline treats its passengers I should not have expected their employees to be any happier. Frontier employs bait-and-switch policies to maintain the ""cheap ticket"" reputation. In reality Frontier's customers are not presented with an honest estimate of the cost of their travel at checkout. My conclusion is that the service one receives from other airlines is well worth the additional 20% in initial ticket costs. You will end up paying that much more to Frontier anyway.",9/22/2014,1,2,1,1,1,1
A Ucfaaay,1,I've flown a lot over the past decade but have never used Ryanair. The first time was a return trip from London Stansted to Santander in May 2014 (FR2612 / FR2613). Despite worries about Ryanair's reputation it was a very positive experience. The flights including 15 kg of baggage and all extras were very reasonably priced. Both outward and return flights landed a few minutes. Return leg saw us being placed in emergency exit seats rather than our allocated seats which meant extra legroom. Cabin was clean. Seats don't recline but were fine. By following all Ryanair's instructions (printing boarding passes etc.) no extra money had to be paid. Would happily use them again in the future.,6/2/2014,5,4,0,NaN,4,8
Alvin Morris,1,I travel regularly on the MAN-AGP service and the cabin staff have always been polite and efficient. Flight deck mostly give information of use and sometimes with humour. Time keeping outbound has been good but return from AGP can be frustrating as other low cost airlines appear to shout loudest and depart on schedule. It may be a case of confronting the ground handling agent as to why this happens so often. The new seats are hard and uncomfortable especially for taller travellers they have a low back that sticks into your lower should blades. Just about bearable on a 2/3 hour trip but any longer and would be torture. Overall a great airline but a few tweaks by management needed on their operational side. They could give the other low cost airlines a run for their money and worth an extra Â£5 each way extra on seat cost. Just tell passengers what they are getting for their money no hidden surprises.,9/28/2014,4,2,4,0,4,9
Anna Jackson,0,The one thing I can say that I liked about this airline was the cheap flight. Unfortunately that is the only positive part of my entire flight from Boston to Phoenix. The seats were so uncomfortable and the flight attendants were rude. When I asked if the movie would start over if I bought a head seat she looked at me like I was stupid and said no. The other flight attendant that was with her glared at me and looked at my seat number like I was going to cause problems for them when my friend asked what was the point of handing out the headsets after the movie already started. I haven't been on a flight in quite some time but I remember it being a pleasant time when customers were treated with respect. I felt like I was an inconvenience to this airline and I will never fly with JetBlue again.,8/13/2013,3,1,2,2,1,1
A Newson,1,Final sector from Dubai to Melbourne QF 10 Jan 14. We had paid for exit row seats and the extra leg room was most appreciated. I was most unimpressed when we boarded in Dubai (after the London - Dubai leg) to find we were unable to use the overhead lockers which we were compelled to use because the crew had their luggage there. When I questioned why I was told there wasn't where else to put it. As customers who have paid extra for these seats I believe the crew should put their luggage in the hold or in another area in the plane. Crews attitude quite patchy. Breakfast very ordinary.,1/20/2014,2,2,1,5,2,7
A Valdivia,1,"6/08/12 Flew from LAX (Los Angeles) to LAS (Las Vegas). Flight was delayed by 20 minutes which was not even bad. We were further delayed in the air for 20 more minutes because President Obama was landing at the same airport as we were. Other than that the flight attendants were courteous the seats were decent had good leg room (I'm 6.2""). Returned on 6/12/12 LAS to LAX. The incoming Flight was delayed for 2.5hrs due to bad weather from the region it was coming from. I got my round trip ticket for $90. I'll definitely fly again!",6/21/2012,5,4,0,NaN,4,10
Anna Kelly,1,Flew from CDG to HKG and HKG to AKL return. The service was excellent. I had swollen legs from the first flight and a customer service rep helped me get a visa in to Hong Kong so I could see a doctor and then got me extra legroom on the next flight. Flight attendants checked on me every 20 minutes or so and got me extra blankets and water as needed. I was very taken care of and they went the extra mile. Overall all 4 flights were great: on time with good food and excellent entertainment. Seats weren't great- the life vest thing is in the seatbelt - but it's economy class. The bathrooms were cleaned often so were sparkling. Overall 4 excellent flights and I would happily take them again.,5/4/2014,4,2,4,5,5,8
A van der Schyff,0,The inflight entertainment only worked for some people mine didn't work at all. The flight was full so we had no option of moving. The flight was more than 6 hours so it was very boring. The were only 2 options for food: Chicken or vegetarian. Naturally most people chose chicken so by the time the staff got to us there was only vegetarian food left. We didn't get much to drink either. I've either been spoiled by Emirates' excellent service or this airline is just very poor because I was absolutely disgusted by the service.,5/29/2014,1,1,3,1,3,2
A Nguyen,0,When I called the customer service representative to voice my displeasure with my flight the representative was rude while speaking and even hung up on me. He offered no help and even attempted to mock me. As beautiful as Cancun was I would never go back if my only option was to fly AeroMexico. Cheap flights means cheap service and even worse customer assistance.,4/25/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
Alwaleed Althani,1,"We had an early morning departure from Boseman Montana, we were a large family and we got a very helpful Delta Airlines check in staff. The flight in itself was nice, both legs were short but I was more comfortable with the older 757-200 seats from Salt Lake City to Las Vegas but they were quite similar, since they were both short flights. There was no meal service but a choice of pretzels or nuts or biscuits and the attendants were allowing us to have more than one thing. All bags came through without issue and on time.",7/31/2015,5,3,3,4,4,8
Alysia Montano,0,"The worst experience of my life. 6 hour delay with no help or info from staff. Gate got changed twice and if it wasn't for other people who had their updates sent to their email none of the other people would have know. The workers were clueless about everything. Once we finally flew to Vegas we waited on the plane for an hour and a half for a gate to open so we could get off. I had my 3 year old with me and she was crying because she was tired and hungry. It is now 6.30 am I'm finally with family, this all started at 7pm Chicago time the day before. Never again will I fly Spirit.",6/16/2015,1,1,NaN,NaN,1,1
Anna Kleinzahaler,1,LAX to San Diego having flown into LAX with Delta and this was the connecting flight. Timetable for this flight allows 50 minutes but in reality it is nearer 20-25 minutes. Nice little Canadair jet very bright and clean inside. Left on time and arrived early. Two cabin staff seemed to be playing good cop bad cop. No drinks offered because it seems the flight is not long enough. Its a great little flight that does not climb too high and so you get a splendid view of Los Angeles. Once the plane was parked up we had to walk along the apron to the terminal building. Slightly longer wait then I had expected for so few passengers to get my luggage from the carousel.,12/18/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,8
A Vandelay,0,YUL-MCO on the Rouge A319. Seats cramped beyond anything I've experienced before. I'd sooner fly a US carrier with stopovers than fly a Rouge configuration again due to the limited seat pitch (I'm 6ft tall). On the other hand I didn't mind the BYOD in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system but the seats need power / usb ports for this to be really useful. I found the entire flight crew to be genuinely friendly and welcoming.,5/8/2014,1,1,3,3,4,3
A Nieves,0,I booked my flight in March for about $120 per person for a flight from Nice to Prague for July. Suddenly and without warning or my authorization or permission Smart Wings notifies Expedia they have canceled my reservation. I checked Expedia and Smart Wing's websites and the same flight was still available. I spoke with Smart Wings emailed them and the only response they gave me was that Expedia should refund my flights and I should re-book the flight at a much higher price that was now available. Expedia didn't help me much either but just told me that I should do what the airline suggested.,5/21/2014,1,0,0,0,1,1
A Vaughan,0,IAD to SFO. Despite booking seats next to each other our seats were changed and we were 10 rows apart. Other couples faced the same problem despite the bookings being on the same eticket. Our previous Continental flight was 4 hrs late with no apology from ground cabin or flight deck staff. Service was very poor.,8/21/2011,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN
Anna Kleinzahler,0,LHR-VIE and VIE-LHR: Both flights left 20-30 minutes late and arrived no later then 10 minutes of the published times. Outward plane a Boeing 737 and return an Airbus 320. The planes looked clean and well maintained. What lets the service down is attention to details and quality of human interactions. The drop down screens show a very old moving map and the safety cartoon. On the return flight the screen was just left down but blank for 40 minutes before some old cartoons were shown. The cabin crew appear to do what is required of them but with no great zeal. Passengers offered a drink and a muffin on outward flight. On the return leg a turkey and cheese sandwich. When I asked for a vegetarian option I was told directly and with no apology that there was not any. Mints offered after we had landed as passengers were on the way out. Another problem is that it is a very long walk at Heathrow to and from the gate used by Austrian. There are various means that help people a long but it can take up to 20 minutes. The new terminal in Vienna had a similar problem although not quite so bad but still a lengthy walk to passport control and I found very badly signposted. Next time I will fly with one of the other airlines. Departure on the return leg at the gate from Vienna was a bit chaotic and could have been better organized.,8/7/2012,3,4,2,2,2,5
Alyssa Stewart,0,First the Easybus service was nightmare as we weren't able to get on the right bus as it was late and when it arrived my kids and I couldn't get on. When we got to the airport we were forced to pay Â£25 for luggage being 1 kg over weight. If that was British airways that would be fine. For the flight you have to pay for food which the prices are ridiculous and the food isn't that amazing. 1 year prior to this occasion my kids and I had to fly to Spain and unfortunately Easyjet messed up our booking and we had to miss a weeding! My advice is only go on Easyjet for a weekend out with your friends other than that better fly on British Airways or another airline.,5/19/2013,2,1,1,NaN,1,1
A Noonan,0,LHR-DEL-KOL and back. Staff were helpful and I did get a seat with extra legroom on one sector. I don't find this airline good. Toilets are not kept clean during the flight. There were no seat covers on any flight sector. Problems with website on smart phone many options simply don't work. Online check in was therefore not possible for me. My seat area also wasn't up to Western standards of cleanliness. There is no menu for food. 'Continental chicken Indian lamb or Indian vegetarian' isn't really enough info. Drinks selection is very limited. Only one beer choice only 4 spirits (no rum). Entertainment: Of the 10 buttons on my console 5 were ripped out and so using the console was tricky. TV selection doesn't exist at all if your language is English movie selection is very limited. Games are so badly produced they are not fun to play at all. The inflight entertainment system is about where it should have been 15-20 years ago.,5/16/2013,2,3,3,1,3,4
A Nuyens,1,We flew from Edmonton to Calgary to Puerto Vallarta. First time flying Canjet some positive - we were on schedule staff were friendly and attentive the food was good! The negatives were some boisterous passengers non-stop rudeness and disregard for passengers within earshot until the pilot intervened with a stern warning. The seats were uncomfortable. The airplane seemed older!,10/4/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,6
Amanda Annisa,0,A3650 ATH-FCO 28th May 2013. One of the crew had a very bad attitude. She never smiled and just dropped the food in front of me in a very rude way without saying anything. Secondly pre-landing I was using an earphone with the music off. She told me to turn it off which I had done. However I still needed to put the earphones on my ear for descent due to discomfort in my ear during that flight. When she saw me still using the earphones she told me again when I said it was already off and she kept telling me in a rude way to turn it off. She refused to check and kept asking me to put down my earphones.,5/30/2013,1,1,3,1,1,NaN
Anna Kleinzahler,1,LHR-Arlanda-LHR. Flight out on an oldish 737-600 comfortable seats no drop down screens - so no screen entertainment good service free tea/coffee. but not food. Cabin staff friendly and seemed interested in their work and passengers. Comfortable economy seats. Although I was amongst the first to arrive at the gate on departure at LHR we could board the aircraft straight away which was a very pleasant change and I wish more airlines would do this. Flight left 20 mins late due to the tug breaking down and having to be replaced and some turbulence en-route. I think the Captain said we were at 4100ft but would descend to a lower level to make the flight smoother. On the return leg I did have to sit by the gate but we all boarded a nearly full flight to leave on time and land back in London 15 mins ahead of schedule. I was in seat 4A which had a bit more leg room which was nice but must be near a heating vent so that at times I wondered if I was in a sauna. All woman crew and Captain kept us well informed about our progress with regular announcements. Over all very good and I would certainly fly with them again.,9/4/2012,4,4,3,0,5,8
A Verrall,0,Flew from AMS to Aruba still have to make the return flight Monday not looking forward to this at all - although at least we have comfort class for the return flight-Row 27. Arrived at Schipol early to avoid traffic delays etc could not check bags in despite already having checked in online once at boarding gate no system no control just a big mess. On the plane we had the last row of seats these hardly reclined at all with little room in front this was no fun for 10 hours. Paid online in advance for entertainment yet had to wait for more than an hour for it to be turned on due to our last row seat - choice of films not good at all. Crew very overworked and did not care at all. Gangway between seats so narrow that if you sat in aisle seat you had constant knocks from crew or passengers walking up and down. No mention that flight would stop in Curacel then got turfed off the plane had to go through customs then queue again to get back on-free seating for this last part of the flight also. Storage was poor on lockers had one of bags placed at the other end of the plane and due to narrow aisle was very hard to get to as the aisle blocked by staff So for the return lest hope Comfort class and row 21 proves better? Thinking of upgrade to Premium Comfort but not sure it is worth it?,9/23/2012,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,2
Amanda Brown,1,Friday 7th June. Melbourne to Christchurch. Paid for the seat only and took on hand luggage. Seat comfort is reasonable but it feels like you are sitting in a sardine can. Luckily the person in front of me didn't recline their seat for the 3.5 hour trip. FA's friendly and did frequent water runs. Was greeted by name as I boarded the flight.,6/10/2013,4,3,0,4,4,7
A O'Brien,1,Auckland to Sydney. Booked economy class but was upgraded to business class and I was most impressed. Seating was extremely comfortable the inflight entertainment was a pleasure and the staff service was excellent without being intrusive. Ground staff were pleasant and helpful and the flight departed on time.,3/15/2012,5,5,4,5,5,9
Anna Kujala,1,I flew from JFK to LHR with my family on 9th May. I was very pleased with the flight experience. I value a good entertainment system more which this Boeing 777 had with personal power outlet than the quality of food. There are restaurants at JFK that offer various choices. The irplane is not a restaurant. Food is a + but my values are on the seat comfort more. Seats were comfortable. Service was very efficient and fast. I also liked the dimmed cabin. Only bad thing was that the AC fan was on a quite heavy mode. Crew were mostly very friendly.,5/13/2014,5,5,3,5,3,10
A Vlasov,1,Athens to London in economy. The flight departed on time and arrived 10 mins early. Very tasty meal served on board much bigger than expected. Several rounds of drinks movies shown during flight. Very attentive cabin staff. Overall an excellent flight for just EUR70.,6/17/2012,5,4,5,4,5,9
Amanda Fisher,1,Flew business class January 2014 it was a special price. We usually fly Qantas or Singapore. No comparison in terms of inflight entertainment and seat comfort I found the staff of Malaysian hit and mostly miss. On our KL To Mumbai the staff were so disinterested it was almost amusing. I rarely eat the food my companions commented it was reasonable and all agreed. Inflight entertainment outdated and seat recline was good flat position was uncomfortable if you can get the special price it's worth it otherwise I would not be happy paying full price for this level of service. On time was always good. Flew Sydney to KL then KL to Mumbai Colombo to KL then KL to Sydney.,1/28/2014,4,2,3,1,2,6
A O'Connor,1,DUB-FCO and LIN-DUB. LIN-DUB delayed by inconsiderate passengers bringing huge bags on board as carry on luggage and by ineptitude of LINstaff. Aer Lingus needs to get a grip of this. Delayed half an hour as people could not seat themselves as people tried to cram bags that would not fit into overhead cabins.,2/25/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,7
A Vonne,0,Depending on which rules they choose to enforce you can never be assured that you will be granted access to their boarding process. I am a young woman with a certified disability. I live 4 hours from Oklahoma airport and after waiting on the check in line presented my travel documents 4 minutes late according to their boarding rules. I was not allowed to check in for my scheduled flight. I was re-routed to an intermediary city where I had to spend the night before catching a flight to my final destination. Do not fly this airline especially if you have children or special needs!,12/6/2012,1,1,1,0,1,NaN
Anna Marie McGinley,1,I travelled from Dublin to London recently. I had a fractured ankle and needed to use a wheelchair. I asked Ryanair for special assistance through their online chat site and I couldn't have got better treatment anywhere. They made my journey so easy as a wheelchair user. Everyone was helpful and made me feel very comfortable and in no way a nuisance. This was the same in London and Dublin.,3/4/2015,5,4,4,NaN,5,10
A Odawara,0,Very mediocre experience and an airline I'll be avoiding in the future. I was flying direct London to Beijing but the quality was worse than some domestic Chinese flights I've taken. I had to change seats a grand total of 4 times. Each time because my inflight entertainment system wasn't working and it wasn't until my fourth seat that the screen was working. During this time the stewards and stewardesses were co-operative in helping me find a seat but not kind or apologetic in any way. As for the food the quality of the Chinese meal was somewhat better than the Western meal but neither especially good. My main complaint about the Western meal was the lack of vegetables and meat. The service was perfunctory and the stewardesses stern and at times rude. I just think they have no concept of what customer service is. They warmed to me slightly as I speak Mandarin and was travelling by myself. All in all Air China will get you from A to B and the stewardesses will bring you your food and drinks but whether or not you have a relaxing enjoyable flight is another matter. Wouldn't recommend them and would prefer to pay extra or fly to China indirect next time to avoid them.,8/13/2012,1,2,2,2,1,5
Amanda McCarthy,0,We flew from Stansted and got there early to book extra leg room. My husbands tall and requires this! For three months both Thomas cook and ourselves have been trying to book extra leg room with this airline! The telephone number published isn't answered and the system throws you out repeatedly just when you think you are nearly there and are about to pay for seats. Journey to Antalya was great as a result. Our return was a nightmare. Once again we got to the airport early. Paid for row one 4 seats at 20.00 per seat. Fine if that's what it takes to be comfy. We were happy. When boarding our seats were changed to row 2 but we had paid for row 1. They said sorry but these had been pre-booked. This service didn't exist. As a result we waited for our refund and my husband flew in the tightest space possible. His knees were into the chair in front are the pitches aimed at five footers. He was so uncomfortable. As a result we came home with a bitterness about the holiday and the airline.,6/10/2014,2,2,4,0,2,3
A Wagner,0,Not a good experience. Flew from Boston to Reykjavik with about one hour to catch my connection to Glasgow to find out on the information board that the flight was 2.5 hours late. At the information desk I was told coldly that this was the case. No excuse no friendly gesture not even a cup of coffee in an airport that only has one coffee machine with endless queues. No comfort on the plane food and coffee have to be paid for. For the small difference in ticket price I shall in future use one of the main airlines where one can expect decent behavior to passengers.,9/1/2014,2,2,0,2,2,3
Anna Midgley,0,Not the same at is was years ago every single flight I've been on has been late and either there was no Satellite service or no TV's.

Amar Raj Singh,0,CA 948 Delhi - Beijing Seat 12 L CA 985 Beijing - San Francisco Seat 82C 13th June. Business Class between Delhi and San Francisco. Some of the worst and oldest aircraft's are being used on this route. Airbus from Delhi to Beijing had very worn out toilets and the toilet bowl did not even flush properly. The 747-400 on the Beijing - San Francisco route was more than 14 years old no 170 deg recline this is an old J class seat with many of the seat reclining and extension systems not working. Recline is partial and at least 2 of the functions on my seat (82 C) were not working. The lower panel on my seat was falling off and lying on the floor. The business class lounge at Beijing is another disaster a dirty smelly shower room with no post use cleaning.,6/16/2013,3,1,4,1,3,2

A Wallace,0,Round-trip Latrobe to Myrtle Beach to visit family. Flight was delayed 3 hours in LTB to fix something on the plane - understandable. But what is really horrible about this airline is that the service is atrocious. I have not encountered a single nice or understanding employee of Spirit. They are unaccommodating and just plain rude. They advertise their flights as cheap but they simply are not by the time you pay all the fees at the end. Also the $9 Fair Club is an absolute joke - none of the fairs are below $40 and you simply cannot get a flight for under $100 after bags and seats.,5/13/2014,1,2,1,1,1,1
A O'Hearn,0,KUL-PVG on A320-200 Business Class seat 6J. For a 5hr30min flight this aircraft was not good - an international flight but was treated like a domestic flight. Pre take-off drinks fine and then although departure was 0155 (delayed to 0245) it was a drink after take off and nothing until 1hr 30mins before landing when breakfast was served. Aircraft old and the seats hard and you couldn't sleep on them. No IFE at all not even music! Would not recommend Business Class on this type of China Eastern Airlines aircraft.,9/9/2012,1,1,4,1,4,2
Anna Richardson,1,I flew to Goa in premium economy with Monarch I would recommend to pay for the upgrade as it really made our flight that much more comfortable. The meals are of a good quality and you get a choice of main and a free bar. Seats were comfy and leg room was ample the entertainment wasn't quite as good as I thought it would have been. The staff couldn't do enough for you I am a nervous flyer and they were great with me.,2/7/2013,4,4,4,3,5,9
A Walster,1,HAM-CPH in economy class. Duration: 35 minutes seat 11C in a CRJ900. Usual excellent facilities for check-in and security in Hamburg. The flight was short and take off was on time landing 15 minutes ahead of schedule. The cabin attendants were dour-faced and unhappy looking and the service was quite poor. If you weren't in business or 'premium economy' you didn't get a full drinks service. I was given 100ml of orange juice in the tiniest drinks container I have ever seen on an airline. It can't be due to time constraints because handing out 100ml or 330ml makes no different to service speed in my opinion. Aside from the rubbish service the aircraft was clean and in a generally good state of repair. I would recommend this flight only because it is a fast and convenient way of getting to Copenhagen. If you want service and proper-sized drinks - take the train.,2/13/2013,3,3,1,0,2,5
Amelia Cook,1,We had a great flight today. It was our first time flying with Allegiant and felt it was a bit of a gamble having read some poor reviews but our flight today between Clearwater and Harrisburg PA was perfect. From the check-in person to the pilots and flight attendants I truly noticed an attention to customer service I was not expecting. It was little things like just being friendly and talking to us like humans not robots that made the biggest impact. It made me feel so glad we chose to give Allegiant airline a chance and look forward to doing so much more in the future. We knew in advance we would be paying extra for luggage and for drinks etc. The rates were still the best and only non-stop available. And the fact that the seats did not recline back was considered a plus by me.,5/5/2014,5,4,4,1,5,10

Staff boarder line rude on DUB to PHL PHL to DUB flights. Delays PHL to Orlando Orlando - PHL. Reduced size of plane PHL to DUB and told customers tough luck if you were in the row that no longer existed total shambles at boarding. Apparently had still been selling the flight at PHL even though massively over booked. In flight entertainment from the ninety's. Will never use them again.

Our flights were on time and regarding the soccer-final Germany-Argentina we received a special service - free wifi and cold- fresh beer. That was excellent. Lufthansa does not provide perfect space and service however as an economy-flyer I trust in the quality of the planes and I'm always satisfied with LH.,8/28/2014,3,2,3,4,4,6
A Orr,0,Flew Paris CDG to Glasgow via Cardiff. Was aware that there was a short stopover at Cardiff but was given the impression that Glasgow bound passengers stayed on board. After all we had cleared security only a few hours earlier. Some on board had even purchased duty free at CDG believing that Glasgow was the only airport they would pass through. How foolish was I (and they). All Glasgow bound passengers had to uplift their belongings leave the plane pass through border control re check-in and then clear security before boarding the same aircraft. Those with duty free over the 100ml limit had to put their baggage in the hold. There is possibly a good explanation as to why this happens but we were never given it either by staff on board or at Cardiff Airport. To me it seemed like an unnecessary and pointless exercise which succeeded only in raising angst levels amongst many of the hapless individuals who were subjected to it. Perhaps a bit of information from flybe would prepare passengers for the nonsense to come.,3/20/2013,3,4,2,0,4,4
Anna Tromel,1,March 28 - departure point Luxembourg on LH6861 to Frankfurt continuing from Frankfurt to Dulles Int'l Airport (Virginia USA) on LH418. Other than for the unfortunate strikes which delayed my original flight plan I found the ground personnel and the flight personnel always helpful polite and very professional. I also appreciated having been warned at least 48 hours ahead of time regarding the strike. It gave me enough time to reschedule and change my itinerary. Lufthansa has always been regarded as a stellar airline. It would be regretful to demote its branding due to the strikes.,4/1/2014,4,3,4,5,5,7
Amil Wanasundara,0,"We flew from Melbourne to Bangkok and back through Bandar Seri Begawan. The interior was plain and the seats were uncomfortable. The worst was the food and service. The service was slow and we were one of the last to be served every time and from Melbourne to Bandar Seri Begawan from Bangkok to Bandar Seri Begawan and from Bandar Seri Begawan to Melbourne there was only one meal option available by the time the food service got to us. This was not the meal we wanted and once the flight attendant said ""try it"" almost to say eat it or go hungry. Not to mention the food we received after all that was bland and tasteless. I fly around a lot and this was the worst airline and service I have ever experienced. The airline was cheap and nothing like their persona. I would not recommend this airline to any one a budget airline would be better.",1/11/2015,1,2,1,3,2,NaN

What a rip off - no meals no entertainment and they arrange a budget airline for the return flight.

Anna Weiland,0,I was on a flight with them from Kilimanjaro to Zanzibar via Dar es Salaam. Operated by a small 20 seater but no complaints. Especially in the front there was enough room. Flight was delayed by one hour but I guess thats was happens in Africa. Tickets could easily be booked online and we confirmed them again in their office in Arusha.

Food is average - similar to Delta or US Airways and staff do the minimum that is required. It is hard to get a drink in between services ask for information or anything else than simply telling which drink we want and which main dish we want. Airline is surprisingly weak.,3/24/2014,2,2,1,3,1,3
A Wechsler,0,Economy Plus from Bangkok-Tel Aviv-Bangkok. Old planes but flight out ok however return a disaster. Invisible staff filthy toilets mediocre food and after four requests and eight hours later I was told they have no English papers on the flight. Unless there is an amazing deal on El Al I will not travel with them again.,10/22/2012,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,3
Anna Wong,0,Flight from Bangkok to Hong Kong just now. The biggest comment is that some of their staff are rude and unhelpful. After the meal a crew member was walking around asking if anyone needed some tea. She walked very fast like she was not intending to serve people anyway so it was impossible to catch her. I finally caught her when she came to clean up our meals. I will never take this airline again if I have a choice.,5/27/2015,2,2,3,3,1,2
A PÃ©retiÃ©,0,We travelled to the British Virgin Islands from 20th - 29th April 2014. We flew LIAT from Antigua (ANU) to Tortola (EIS) and on our inbound flight from EIS to Barbados (BGI) for our flight back to London. The only positive thing is that we didn't lose our luggage. Now for the downside: Upon booking our tickets we had no idea (and only discovered once onboard the LIAT aircraft) that they were stopping at numerous islands before arriving at our destination meaning a flight that would take 20 mins would end up taking 1.5 hrs. After an 8hr flight from London we landed at ANU and discovered we were going through St Maarten before Tortola. We took off 30mins late for no apparent reason. In St Maarten the wait was supposed to be 15 minsâ€¦we waited 1hr. There was no air conditioning during that hour. The way back was much worse. What would have been a 2hr flight took 5hrs. It took us 5hrs to fly from Tortola to Barbados because we did Tortola-St Maarten. St Maarten-St Kitts. St-Kitts-Antigua. Antigua-Barbados. The flight from ANU-BGI is 1.5 hrs and we asked for food on board - no food. On that same flight the toilets didn't work. The staff weren't kind and warm. Next time we'll be flying via a private company much less expensive more reliable and quicker.,5/1/2014,1,2,1,0,2,1
Amit Dubey,1,Toronto to Boston return. A problem with booking was solved extremely quickly via email. Their lounge in Toronto was excellent for an economy-class ticket (free wifi snacks and coffee). As an added plus there was a free seat next to me on both legs. Above all that cheaper than Air Canada and American Airlines.,2/1/2012,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
Annalisa Stevens,1,Flew from Sydney to Bangkok via Jakarta in August 2012. Flight was on time. Plane was A330-200 and looked new. Seats advertised as fully flat bed although when lying down your legs were at a slight angle downwards. Plenty of leg room. There were 7 business passengers in the 2 business cabins (separated by Galley). Flight attendants were very friendly and attentive without being overbearing. Someone was always going through the cabin and any request was happily complied with. I could not fault the service and product received. Check in was very competent with a friendly male staff member.,8/23/2012,5,4,5,4,5,9
A Weinberg,1,JFK to LAX in Main Cabin Select (Premium Economy). Flight time 6 hours. Priority check-in and boarding which is standard for PE however the added bonus of priority security was great. The cabin has purple mood lighting and leather seats - a nice change from the standard aircraft interiors of other US domestic carriers. Drinks and food can be ordered on your individual entertainment screens. Being Main Cabin Select all food and drink is free. I had a turkey sandwich which was very nice followed by pringles. Drink selection was very good - wide range of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Impressed to see Glenlivet scotch whiskey on the menu. Cabin staff were friendly and attentive. Entertainment options were solid. Overall a very positive flying experience - V America are a step above US and Australian domestic airlines.,7/5/2012,5,5,4,5,4,9
Amit Shah,0,LHR-TAS-LHR economy. When checking in at LHR I was informed that the flight would be making an unscheduled stopover at Paris CDG. The rumour had it that it was to pick up the UZB president's daughter. All this meant the flight to TAS would take 9hrs long 2 hrs longer than normal. Some people confirmed such unscheduled stopovers were quite commonplace. I was not impressed. Inflight service is pretty bad. So bad that when you call the stewardess they do not turn up. Even when they turn up they are so unhappy to be serving you so rude it is quite unbelievable. I did not eat the food that was served so can not comment on that. On the way back I paid the head stewardess $100 to sit in business class. Seats are good not flat bed but of large size.,10/5/2009,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,2
A Pagan,1,HND-MUC-ATH on A346. 24 hours before I checked in on a seat on emergency exit. I was surprised to find out that they had a different lay out so no extra leg room. Thankfully economy section 30% full so I jumped in the seat in front of the bulk. The seat was quite comfortable. Food and beverages quite good. On time performance. Now on the below par section. The cabin was extremely cold and the blankets were small and thin. Complaints made but nothing changed. IFE a bit old without remote control tough to navigate on a low resolution screen. A worn out touch screen with ok variety on movies though. Poor audio and the headsets completely useless. Cabin crew quite the opposite of ANA crew on my inbound FRA-HND. Actually robotic. No smiles no interaction. They served lunch 30 minutes after take off and then disappeared. Only one of them seated in the galley area with a tray of water and juice on a self service mode. After 9 hours they served a dinner box (again as in lunch there was a choice between Japanese and Western). Priority on my luggage was not honored in Athens as my suitcase came out after 20 minutes waiting on the carousel. All in all a below par flight from LH.,4/10/2014,3,4,3,3,2,6
Anne Norwawi,1,I took the flight from Xian to Kuala Lumpur on my business trip and tried business class for the first time. It was perfect. The flatbed was great for red eye flight and the cabin services was tip top.,8/26/2014,5,5,5,5,5,10
A Welling,0,"Flew from Hong Kong to San Fran and around the US in late May. I am not a fussy flyer at all and can usually go to sleep easily. I am also an Aussie meaning I am used to the 'service' Qantas provides. However after my experience with United I am going to go easy on Qantas. I'll start my review with - ""wow"". It actually takes more effort than less to be as terrible as United. From the no entertainment system on-board (standard I'm told on a 12 hour flight) terrible food (I live in Asia and I know what bad food is) multiple gate changes (5 in total in 1 hour) and 2 hour delay (no apology). Then there was the possibly the rudest individuals I've ever met posing as flight attendants. They were not only dismissive cold and patronising towards guests they actually made the whole flight a tense and uncomfortable environment. In summary I don't understand UA's play. They act like aâ€˜low cost airline. Your people are your business.",6/23/2014,1,3,1,1,1,1
Amith Telagavi,1,Very good and clean aircraft. Most of the flights were scheduled on time crew members attitude while giving safety instructions was bad. I would recommend EasyJet for their very lucrative pricing for short haul offerings on time flights and reasonably new aircraft.,5/10/2014,5,3,0,NaN,3,8
A Palomo,0,BHX-FRA-GIG 27/04/15. Return EZE-FRA-BHX 18/05/15. Flight from Birmingham with layover at Frankfurt then on to Rio De Janeiro was nearly faultless. Cabin crew were very attentive and friendly. The equipment used was 747-8 which was a delight fly on. Good selection of in-flight entertainment and food was also good. I asked for a pack of toothbrush and toothpaste and was given straightaway without questions asked and the lady FA had a friendly smile. Flight back from Buenos Aires was somewhat hit and miss. They were asking passengers for an upgrade for a minimum cost. I spent sometime travelling around South America and was down to my last few dollars so wasn't able to avail their promo. I found out later the they have upgraded quite a few passengers even though some of them were not frequent fliers. I am a Miles and More member and also I have got a frequent flier from SK which belongs to Star Alliance and I earned my points for quite some time now. I felt left out by the upgrade and so I asked one of the staff why the Miles and More members had been left out and my queries were rudely brushed aside telling me that 'You only fly economy'. Some of the FA's on board were friendly enough apart from one female FA with a really bad attitude. When I asked for a pack of toothpaste and toothbrush she immediately told me off they haven't got any and why did I bother to asked because I was in the economy section and then she walked away. When I asked one of her colleagues I was immediately handed a pack. I thought that being a Miles and More membership had gone to waste. I'll be thinking twice about flying with Lufthansa again.,5/27/2015,4,4,3,3,3,6
Anne Perry,1,Cyprus-Amman-Bangkok return. Usually use Emirates but RJ â‚¬600 cheaper so decided to try them. All flights were on time staff polite food quite good with a choice.

I booked through their office in Nicosia and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly.,6/28/2009,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
Amparo Beltri,0,"Yesterday we were on a direct flight from Lagos to Nairobi except that without previous notice the plane landed in Cotonou Benin for over one hour. Not only that but the airplane didn't have air conditioning during the first two ours of flight.

I can't believe that they call themselves ""The pride of Africa"".",12/29/2014,1,1,0,0,1,NaN
Anne Sheppard,1,Luton to Nice 13th June. Had to take my motobility scooter as I have a serious back problem. The scooter was free and I and my sisters were escorted all through from start to airline very quickly.

A Panah,1,THR-MHD-THR. Excellent service on A300-600. Well-stocked lounge in Tehran and business class check-in done by Mahan Air. Onboard 60-inch seat pitch and offered drinks and hot/cold towels. Both ways there a choice of delicious meal. Also very cheap at only Â£110 return in business.,8/28/2010,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
A Weston,0,Worst flight ever. YYZ-KEF - Over 5 hours and they wanted 8 Euros for a sandwich. When we boarded the plane it was literally 92 Fahrenheit. The crew were rude and they took 30 minutes to get a coke for you.,5/4/2014,1,1,1,4,3,NaN
Amy Blevins,1,"It was the first time my children had flown, so I wanted it to be good. From the beginning, JetBlue kept me happy. I had TSA precheck when we arrived, and I didn't ask for it. When we boarded the plane, we boarded first because we had a small child. There was no extra charge for this. Our flight took off 20 min early so we arrived early. During the flight, we were quickly offered snacks and a drink. The attendant came around selling ear buds for $5 to use with the TV at each seat. Having your own TV made the flight enjoyable. At the end of the flight, deplaning was just as pleasant. The price was also better than anyone else, and there were no problems with my luggage. One more thing-my very picky husband who is 6'3"" had plenty of legroom. We did not upgrade to even more space, but he still had plenty of legroom and was very comfortable in a normal seat!",7/1/2015,5,5,5,5,5,1
A Paraskeva,1,Flew four times with Ryanair once on 10/01/14 and 13/03/14 from Birmingham to Dublin and return FR663-FR666 and FR663-FR668. Both flights on time friendly cabin crew and good PA announcements with a detailed journey of the flight. Cabin crew served a smile with their service and was polite on all the flights I've encountered with them. Return flight on 13/03/14 FR668. Cabin crew very friendly.

A Wichman,1,Cheap airfares. Great customer service. Flew from Brisbane to Sydney kiosk at Brisbane airport was great quick and easy - flight was on time to Sydney flew back from Sydney no kiosk so had to wait in line which was a bit of a wait. Flight was like Jetstar and Virgin Australia other than smaller seats but I saved $500 on my 1 day trip to Sydney flying with Tiger as the other airlines were at ridiculous prices. Definitely would fly again with them Staff were great. We arrived at airport 1.5hrs before flight so we would not have any problems. No problems at all.,9/15/2013,5,4,5,0,5,10
Anne Taplin,0,My husband and I were refused to fly because he had an airline approved oxygenator to take on as hand luggage and it would not be used in flight. We had purchased First class tickets to from Seattle to Hawaii they put us on another Airline those seats were economy and the cost of those tickets were $360.00 pp and we had paid over $700 pp - they gave us a refund of $105 pp.,7/16/2012,1,1,1,1,1,1
A Parker,0,The check-in security procedure is far too invasive including asking to see photographs on my camera itinerary on my laptop receipts etc. I understand the need for security but looking at personal photographs and items on my laptop is beyond ridiculous. The onboard service is mediocre food below mediocre and the quality of aircraft is below average - on two 6+ hour international flights we were subject to viewing in-flight entertainment on projection screens at the front of each section of the aircraft. My luggage was left in Tel Aviv even though there was a 5 hour layover.,1/14/2010,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,3
Amy Chan,1,NYC-CAN-KUL round-trip: Let me begin by saying their prices are very cheap so don't expect SIA First Class when you know you got a good deal so set your expectations right. NYC-CAN: New Boeing 777 smelling fresh with top notch media so many English and Asian movies/TV shows! I know people complain that the stewardess kept asking us to close the window blinds during the flight but I have a theory. They want the passengers to be calmer and give everyone the opportunity to sleep as much with all these different sleep cycles. I can actually say it was a wonderfully calm flight. The only downside is be prepared to be competitive with storage space. CAN-KUL: I can tell this is an old airplane so for the short flight I'll put up with the noise and hard seats. Overall great experience. Passengers off the flight in 10 minutes versus regular flights that take 15-20 minutes!,12/29/2014,5,4,5,5,5,9
A Wilianto,0,Had several flights with HKG Airlines in the past year and every single one of them was delayed. The worst one was last night supposed to fly out HKG-PVG at 9.30pm but did not take off until 1am! Their excuse? Always the same due to the late arrival of the aircraft. Ground staff last night even tried to lie by saying there was a thunderstorm in Shanghai which I knew from a friend in SH and the weather forecast that there was no thunderstorm. Since we will not arrive in Shanghai until 3am due to the delay ground staff in HKG promised there will be shuttle buses provided from the Pudong airport to four different downtown locations in Shanghai. What happened when I arrived in PVG? The promised services do not exist! It was almost 4am and no one we can talk to. Some of us tried to stop flight attendants who were marching out of the terminal to find the answer again with no success. In the end we had to catch and pay for our own taxi. Agreed with other passengers not worth the money at all and will not fly with them again.,8/7/2012,1,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,2
Anne Troughton,0,We were a family of 6. 4 adults and 2 children travelling in August. we were told that we could not book seats or upgrade on line. We arrived at the check in more than 3 hours before departure and were not given seats together in fact we were several rows apart. On the return journey because of flight delays we missed our connecting flight. We were told that the adults were booked to go on one plane and the children on another. we pointed out that it was unacceptable to have our children travelling on their own in a foreign country but it took an hour to sort it out and even then we still had to travel on 2 separate planes. Would we ever travel with Martinair again? The answer is a definite no.,9/10/2007,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,1
A Pascual,0,I traveled on the 28th of Dec 2014 for a month LHR-MNL and back. It is such a shame that PAL is using an old A340-300 acquired from Iberia which is more or less 15 years old already. The aircraft does not have IFE built in on their seats they provide ipad mini's though but they have a very poor choice of entertainment system. The upholstery is totally worn out stained and the aircraft itself looks so dirty. PAL should do something about these problems as it is a shame to flying customers especially foreigners who wants to visit the Philippines. As a flag carrier they should improve their services because as what the saying goes first impression always lasts. Never again with PAL on a LHR-MNL flight unless they start using the 777-300er again!,2/6/2015,2,1,2,1,4,1
Amy Smith,0,Flight was scheduled for 11.42 am on May 2 2014 From St Pete to Huntington WV. Delayed 2 hours then 3 hours finally boarded around 5pm just to have to deviate due to mechanical problems.

Next morning scheduled to leave at 10am on May 3 2014 boarded early and again with the mechanical problems. Finally boarded the third plane and arrived in Hunting 24 hours late.,5/4/2014,2,3,1,0,2,NaN
Annegret Borrmann,1,Flying from the US I always would prefer a non-US Airline. I have been flying LH for quite some time but service and especially food has deteriorated. Since we prefer Airbus instead of flying Boeing we always used the connection via Munich. Maybe next time we will try either KLM or Air France provided we can chose those airlines both ways. We experienced the US airlines with very low standard: service/food/and seating.,3/24/2014,3,4,2,4,3,7
A Patel,0,ORD (Chicago) - AUH-BOM (Mumbai India) in March 2012. I'm 6 feet tall. Negatives: They have the least amount of leg-room I've experienced on any airline. The articulating seat pan makes the problem unbearable - when you recline the seat back your seat cushion moves forward thrusting your knee into the seat in front of you. The worst part is that I had to endure with this on a 14+ hour transatlantic flight. Understaffed - slow service. They only allow 7kg/~15lbs for carryon baggage. This equates to a near empty rollaboard or a small backpack. Positives: You can redeem American Airlines miles on their airline. I got safely to my destination.,11/18/2013,1,1,2,3,2,2
Ana Kothe,1,We flew economy from Puerto Rico to Germany and back (14/12/13-11/1/14). On the San Juan-Frankfurt flight the entertainment was outdated but on the way back we had TVs on the back of the seat in front of us which for a 7-euro fee made the 10-hour flight tolerable. Very nice if it were free since most of the movies and TV shows dated from 3-10 years back. Regarding space it is minimal but since my husband and I are on the small side not unpleasant. The meals are about average for long-haul flights as are amenities like pillows and blankets. The flight attendants are more chipper than average. Regarding the baggage requirements. If you look on the internet for passenger opinions and if you scrutinize Condorâ€™s policies you will notice that they state a 50-lb weight limit for the one checked-in suitcase and 13 lbs for the carry on. We pre-weighed and triple-times pre-weighed our check-in and carry-ons. However no one neither in San Juan nor in Frankfurt seemed to care about said limits people around us simply argued a bit at check in and overweight baggage accepted. Speaking of check-in: in Frankfurt â€“ as noted in other reviews â€“ it was awful. Awful in the sense that every Condor flight was checking in at the same time. Although no assistance regarding kiosk check-in was given whatsoever my impression was that checking in through a kiosk may be a better way to go. What is the benefit of having passengers (like us) who arrive over two hours ahead and are freaked-out by the extraordinary line: blood pressure rises worries escalate while reading the 45-minute-to-the-counter signs with no one to guide or help out. Can Condor improve their Frankfurt in-airport service? My last comment is that the fare was not that great. We have flown other airlines at economy for less and received more.,1/17/2014,2,2,3,3,3,6
Annemarie Fox,1,Gatwick to Joburg (troubles just beginning to brew in Libya). The start seemed off putting when I noticed an extra three hours on the flight time from Tripoli to Joburg which the booking office could not explain also when I was not on the reservations list at check-in. However the latter was sorted without hassle. Service on flight to Tripoli was fine plane new and clean food good. However we landed in a sandstorm which was worrying. Fortunately we were herded along to the departures lounge as all signs in Arabic. Onward flight delayed by a couple of hours due to sandstorm. Toilets at the airport were inadequate in number but reasonably clean. We were then taken on what felt like a mystery tour on an airport bus down a dirt road - turned out to be to the other end of the runway where our plane sat all on its own amidst military aircraft. The three hour extra time was now clear as it was a much smaller plane than expected (a few passengers had seats allocated on row numbers which were not on the smaller plane - however there was enough room and extra for everyone boarding). Once again food and service fine. There was a refuelling stop at Kinshasa. During my week in S Africa the revolution in Libya took off. I expected to lose my money and have to rebook myself back on an alternative carrier. However when I contacted Afriqiyah in Joburg they said I was re-booked on Egyptair travelling back same night as my original booking. They sent me email confirmation and my trip home went smoothly. The Afriqiyah staff were helpful and efficient in spite of what was obviously a stressful time for them. On the basis of value for money Afriqiyah is excellent but be prepared for a journey with a difference.,4/10/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,6

A Paul,1,San Francisco to Japan to Philippines. Service was excellent. Great crew. Great attention. I requested a seat change a while ago and when we got off the flight in Japan a service member was holding a sign with our name and walked us to change seats. We were impressed.

A Willis,1,HK-Toronto via Taipei - Economy. It was my second time taking this route and I am just as impressed as the first time around at how well this airline is run. The seats are great for economy the food is excellent cabin crew are top-notch and most important this airline is by far the most 'on time' airline I've even flown with. We were about 15 minutes late out of the gate in Taipei but the pilots made up for it by getting us to Toronto an hour and a half early. With the consistent quality excellent pricing and value I am still not sure why this airline is still only four star. I normally take the same route with Cathay at almost double the price for a typically terrible customer experience. The Asia - N. America carrier scene is getting shook up by EVA and there should be more attention paid to it. Well done!,10/28/2013,5,4,5,4,5,9
A Pearson,0,"It was not less expensive than regular Air Canada. We flew regular Air Canada Toronto to Palm Beach International and flew home from Orlando to Toronto on Rouge. The Rouge leg was more expensive but we had no choice to fly it as they only do Rouge to/from Orlando now it seems. Worst part we brought Ipads for our children and ourselves but only 2/4 of us could log on to the in-flight ""entertainment"" because we were told by flight attendant there is a limit to how many people can log on during the flight.

They didn't want to pull our luggage off for me I was expected to go without for 36 hours. They put us in a hotel in Bangalore not told about another stop in India before we landed in The Maldives. We had no information about anything really we were looking on the boards at the airport and most of the Air India flights we either delayed or cancelled.

Anastasia Gkika,0,A3600 14/10/2014 Athens to London and return 22/10/2014 A3603. Me and my family have been using Aegean Airlines for years and we have always been happy with the service. I was disappointed to find out that they have stopped playing movies during flights. On my return flight from Athens to London last week there was entertainment system at all. No music no movies. I think this is the last time I will use Aegean. Very boring flight.,11/5/2014,2,3,3,1,3,1
A Pedersen,1,DAR-CAI-FRA-CPH. Small aircraft good service no alcohol. Check-in in Dar pleasant though complained could not check in my luggage beyond Copenhagen though with another Star Alliance airline. However the airline granted me an untitled free lounge access in Dar instead which was a fair deal. DAR-CAI on time food served fast. The flight is only 4 hours at night. Thus it was pleasant to see 2 sandwiches were instantly handed out upon departure as dinner and then very shortly after came the breakfast. That rendered the options to sleep onboard to half an hour before descent or â€“ to be waken up and have the breakfast in the middle of the night. Special meals taken care of. Missed my LH flight to Copenhagen as they had only granted 50 minutes. Was rebooked to a flight within 2 hours later.

Annette Marks,0,We recently flew business class Brisbane-Singapore-Abu Dhabi-Brussels and return Paris-Abu Dhabi-Singapore- Brisbane. I am a coeliac so ordered gluten free meals. The standard of the meals can only be described as very poor and inedible in some cases. My husband's meals were also very ordinary. We have both had far better meals in economy on other carriers! The service from the flight attendants was also very mediocre with requests for tea/coffee going unanswered. There was little recognition of business class with priority boarding etc. When you pay extra I think it is reasonable to assume you would expect extra. We were bussed for what seemed miles in 40 plus degree heat to our plane in Abu Dhabi and were late leaving with no explanation. This resulted in us being late for the remainder of the journey. Two pluses I can mention are the bed configuration and the new lounge at Charles de Gaulle Airport.,8/26/2014,1,3,1,3,2,1

We had been informed that Nanaimo Airport has a critical density of fog but that they would try to get everybody across. The landing could not be done due to the fog so they flew us back to Vancouver. By that time it was close to midnight. All passengers were asked to go to a nearby service desk.

Bus to terminals in SVO. SVO-DXB on Airbus 319. No IFE but who cares. 16 seats left in economy I volunteered to give up seat 7C to the back row next to toilets as it allowed for stretching. Service devoted. Alcohol charged as only free on intercontinental flights. I would assume that SVO-DXB is pretty much intercontinental? Service excellent though by sitting on last row one is left with no food options but the ones left (clalf-meat) was good. English poor-very poor. Staff charming young and in excellent mood. DXB-NBO operated by Kenya Airways. Overbooked on business class 1 person was downgraded. I got one of the very last seats in the middle of an 2-3-2 configuration. But the staff were good hard-working in a sparkling mood and attentive. Ordered 2 drinks and was given 2 of each (as to make up for busy FAs and few rounds of service). This happened to everybody who cared but only at the first service - IFE on large plenum screen worked surprisingly well. Good information from captain and purser. Luggage delivery at the belts in Nairobi stressful and confusing. Monitors were not properly working.,7/29/2013,5,5,3,2,5,8
A Perry,0,Flew out 4/7/14. Flight out from Gatwick to Barcelona was an hour late with no explanation. 07/07/14 - Big storm at Barcelona which meant delays on other carriers but the Vueling flights were mainly cancelled. Our flight was showing as still going but delayed so we checked in a kept an eye on the information boards. When suddenly the flight disappeared from the board no announcement nothing on the board to say what had happen. We asked a member of staff (after finally finding one) and were told that our flight had been cancelled to go to the baggage collection pick up our bags and go back out and queue up at the Vueling desk to book another flight. The queue was very long at least 200 people in front of us and at least 400 behind us. We were offered a flight back home the following afternoon with no compensation for additional hotel or food costs. An absolutely terribly airline.,7/17/2014,1,2,1,1,1,2
Annette Van Akker,0,Flew Sydney to Singapore ScootBiz. Seats hard no recline and 100mls of tepid water free! Save your money! Food was disgraceful had to purchase everything and took 50mins to claim our luggage from the carrousel. Jetstar is first class compared to Scoot so stick to Aussie budget airlines.,12/9/2013,1,1,1,1,1,NaN
A Wilson,1,"ORD-MSY, 1st July. Online check-in was swift and simple, no delays and friendly ground and air crew. Basic plane so no wifi or IFE but it was only a 1.5 hour flight so can't really complain. A bit of a bumpy landing in the rain but very well-handled by captain and crew. Was served a complimentary drink but no food, but again only a 1.5 hour flight. Would happily recommend AA to others.",7/13/2015,3,3,3,NaN,4,7
Annettte Flotwell,0,"SJC-MAD in an old cattle class plane. The most uncomfortable seats. I got a bad back the seats are hollow so you have to sit upright for eleven hours without leaning against anything. The front seat was leaning back so I was jammed in like a sardine. My partner is 6'6"" he was so unhappy that he was hardly able to stand up. I really suffered spent most of the time standing up because I couldn't stand it in my seat. As there was no pork free choice of meal I went for vegetarian which was horrible dry rice and no sauce accompanied by cold carrots. I showed it to a stewardess who kindly organised some tomatoes and olive oil from business class. It was certainly a never again experience. On the other hand Madrid - Bordeaux was fine a fantastic comfy bombadier airplane with good seats and a friendly service. Go figure We did the other trip in business class which is a different review all together. Oh yes there was no TV screen at all but they had the cheek to give you an in flight magazine with non existing film channels!",10/28/2014,3,1,1,1,3,4
A Peter,1,Vienna-Bucharest-Cluj-Vienna. It was probably one of the best airlines I had flown so far. Their service was astounding as well as the whole crew. They served us a hot and filling meal on the Vienna - Bucharest leg (2 omelettes with ham bacon potato croquettes and a large fruit salad. 3 drinks had been included. On the Bucharest-Cluj leg (One large ham and cheese salad sandwich with a chocolate rum cake and 3 drinks) and on the final leg it was a large salad consisting of just about everything! Crew were highly attentive and kind. will definitely fly them again!,7/17/2013,5,5,5,3,5,10
Anders Pedersen,1,CPH-BRU-Bujumbura. Excellent trip lots of space. Long haul new aircraft quite noisy cabin clean staff professional a bit rigid and no smile were noticed. Servings fairly frequent enough drinks. Serve even a good sparkling wine on economy class but only on day-flights. Food exceptionally good special request met to perfection. Good information from captain. Economy flex tickets do not provide additional benefits on board - there is just one monkey class on the long haul. Airline seems now to have finally decided to become a full service carrier and have dropped discount modality.,3/4/2011,4,NaN,NaN,NaN,NaN,9
